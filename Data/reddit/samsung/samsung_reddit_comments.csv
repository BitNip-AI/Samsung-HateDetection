43;14pxi1d;Thortok2000;1688649389.0;">Your example was very unreasonable for someone who asks others to be reasonable.

Welcome to the point. If the premise is ""some feedback is unreasonable"" then the example is *intended* to be as unreasonable as possible, the most unreasonable it could possibly be. That was the entire point of the example. It's called hyperbole.

There is no way you can look at feedback asking for a million dollars and walk away thinking ""all feedback is reasonable."" Thus, the point is proven: *some* feedback *is* unreasonable.

And your premise of ""all feedback should be acted upon"" is thus *dis*proven.

>multiple people supported the initiative. You're in the minority

Logic doesn't care about majority. They gave a valid reason why they aren't doing it. If you have a counter-argument, it would involve proving their reason incorrect, not ""but a lot of people want it.""

>arguing over nothing

You're the one arguing. I am simply asking you to be reasonable. Apparently you have some objection to that and wish to argue about it.

The mods are not your slaves. Just because feedback is given or is supported by a majority doesn't mean that will be followed unthinkingly, especially if following that feedback would actually do harm.

Rather than ignoring the feedback or giving a simple no, they *communicated* in detail *why* they won't do it.

This is a perfectly acceptable response that is transparent and open. Sulking because you didn't get your way (or because someone you agree with didn't get theirs) is being unreasonable.

To clarify, the feedback that was given was reasonable. Your response blaming them for not acting on it is what was unreasonable.";0

I literally claimed I *would* if your responses warrant it.

You continue to say incorrect things. Such as this.

Stop saying incorrect things, or stop replying. Or make an argument in support of yourself that isn't incorrect.

Those are the three ways this resolves. (Or a fourth way- the mods lock this.) Take your pick. You already know my preference.

This is now basically an argument, just like you clearly seem to want, as you would rather defend yourself against the criticism than calmly accept it. I'd like this argument to resolve asap. Whether that happens or not is up to you.";0

[This, is not true.](https://youtube.com/watch?v=CYnFhpNSbdk&feature=share8) Resolution doesn't affect battery life much because a) the extra pixels can't be turned off, even when you use a lower resolution and b) the display engine doesn't really get that much more work done with a higher resolution because it's optimized to do it (the exception is when gaming).

Just the number of apps that have software optimisation for them are very low, excluding really popular apps.

For example, I know someone who develops a pretty popular webcomic app. And they told me that its really difficult to work with because the screen is too wide for it to default into mobile mode but too square-y to default to tablet/desktop mode.

In the end they basically have to develop a newer UI layout just for foldables.";0

118;14xth02;SHADOWxFLAME;1689189939.0;"I had a pixel 6 ( I know it's the previous phone) but from my experience it was my worst phone I ever had. It heated up constantly, the battery was inconsistent. For instance some days the batter would be amazing and at the end of the day still have 40% while other days with sometimes even less usage would be on 10%, I felt many apps wasn't optimised and would crash a lot. 

I also prefer 1 UI as I felt it's most customisable and offers a lot more as I felt the pixel customisation was rather basic compared to one UI, although it was definitely a more simple UI. Overall the UI is personal preference.

For things like gaming it would warm up considerably more than other phones but for the most part did stay semi consistent frames 

The Bluetooth connectivity was the absolute worst though, it would never be able to maintain the Bluetooth connection Especially if I had a watch and earphones in a the same time.

The exclusive features available to me I felt it wasn't something I ever really needed, but I know people did actually love them a lot so again personal preference.

The camera was probably the best part with it being a really good camera and I don't think I really ever had an issue with the camera.

TLDR:

Compared to using the S23 now I'd say the S23 is far superior to the pixel 6 and is far more customisable with a much more stable phone and better battery. Id recommend the S23 over the pixel phone.";0

188;14wut67;tattooedmama3;1689105886.0;It depends on where you are and how new of a phone you have how soon you'll get them, but Samsung has gotten much better about timely updates in recent years.;0

190;14wut67;BartPRO1000000;1689109074.0;Europe here, the fastest updates I've seen. Getting security patches monthly, and always the newest ones. Got the May one on like the first or the second. The July took longer because there were bug fixes and camera improvements they needed to make. The June one was instant. All the previous ones starting from March were basically instant.;0
191;14wut67;siliconevalley69;1689111124.0;"They do monthly security updates and have for years. Usually takes 6 months to get the new Android version (September--> Jan/Feb) but who cares. 

Google's Android build is way behind Samsung at this point. 

One UI is the definitive version of Android. 

Most of the major Android features the last 5-7 years since the launch of OneUI have been Google finally adding things that Samsung has had for years.

Google's puts out their buggy ""final"" build for the new Pixel in September and spends 6 months letting Pixel owners struggle with it while they actually finalize it. Samsung spends 6 months and delivers something that's finished.

Pick a feature. Like blue light filter. That was on Samsung phones for 2 years before Google added. That's when I stopped caring. Does Google even have long screenshots yet?

The S23U is a perfect phone. Best all around phone since the N10+. Best phone sold today. 

There's just no phone that delivers software+hardware like Samsung. Apple is a close second.";0

The S22 Ultra got their Android 13 in November.
So for the S23 Ultra, I'm 100% certain that they'll receive the next major update in Q4 this year

This is all for US carrier unlocked Snapdragon devices btw. Other regions and carrier locked devices may differ. From what I've learned, Asian countries get the updates first and carrier locked devices get the updates sooner than unlocked.";0
196;14wut67;Generalrossa;1689117483.0;Pretty much better then pixel updates these days. So they are coming before pixel get theres. Also we get 4 years of OS upgrades and 5 years of security. So best in the game.;0
197;14wut67;dotjzzz;1689121077.0;About as good as it gets. The only competition is Google, and that's only because they have three, four this year, phones per year to update and they provide one fewer updates than Samsung.;0

They were able to fix things using a remote control app called ""Smart Tutor"". The phone still stops apps from working every so often, and I have to do a warm restart.

But sometimes it gets delay 5 days after a month starts

It uses enough battery that iOS will show as connected to 5G when it's available/present, but actually stays connected on 4G unless the software determines 5G is needed (downloads etc)


Similar reason why, on Samsung, Power Saving will turn off 5G by default.

282;14wsram;Lover0fL1fe;1689107576.0;As someone who went from an A series phone to a s21 FE a while back, I can say that it was the best decision I made in a while.

283;14wsram;technicallyademon;1689111827.0;"S21FE hands down. A54 is newer, but less reliable than the S21FE.

284;14wsram;BeerPizzaGaming;1689115866.0;A54 much better battery but no built in wireless charging and the encasement/ body of the phone is worse.  The S21 has a much better fit/ finish/ look/ feel.  With either I would advise a case but with the  A54 it is mandatory.  This is primarily due to the way the lenses are (A53 was a much better design/ higher quality build IMO) and how cheap and easily the screen can/ will scratch.;0
285;14wsram;No-Guarantee-9647;1689119259.0;Please, please take my hard won advice, and that of more than a few others I've spoken too, and DO NOT buy a phone without a flagship chip in it. My A51 I bought in 2020 aged like fine dogwater. It was great for the first few months (coming from a four year old J36) but it only took one or two android updates to slow it massively. It was genuinely painful to use, especially when I'd see (flagship) phones two or three years older loading up webpages and swiping through menus with many times the speed and half the latency. Finally replaced it recently with a Pixel 7, though we'll see how that ages. So far, the difference is more than night and day. I would take less updates all day over the horrible performance of A series phones.;0

Another thing to keep in mind that Exynos are terrible in terms of overheating which leads to lag/stuttering and even worse battery. 

Mid range Exynos in the A54 as I've read isn't that bad. I just think Exynos in flagships aren't powerful and efficient enough to power the flagship itself.

Also, using it in the car through bluetooth with spotify and google maps navigating... the phone will drain rather quickly even while it's plugged into the car usb charger.

I may go into a best buy to see which phone would suit me better as $5 extra a month is a drop in the bucket. I think I would miss the macro camera on the ultra if I went with the plus. I've heard nothing but great things about the ultras battery life. Btw, I'm looking at the 512gb versions of the phones. I know Samsung phones have less storage available to use than Pixel phones and with downloading themes and apps on it, it won't leave as much room for photos and videos on the device. I like to be able to record and edit videos on my phone and in order to do that, the files need to be on the device locally. Of course I could get one of them in the 256gb version and then transfer them to my Tab S8 to edit them there. But 4k videos and high res photos take up a considerable amount of space. And the 512 is future proofing my phone because I will intend on keeping it for much longer than 1-2 years if I'm financing it for 36 months. I know 256 is good for most people but I don't want to have to worry about running low on storage. And if I'm going with the ultra, I might as well get the 512gb.;0

23U Pros-
Battery - easily lasts most people a day+
10X zoom is a game changer 
Screen looks great in the sun
Cons-
Heavier 
Same form factor as every other phone for the last 15 years 

Fold4 Pros-
Multi-tasking king! Side by side 2 full apps, plus a floating app (or even 3 plus the float) 
Uniqueish, moreso in the USA. Other countries have more fold options. 
When taking pictures, you can see your recent shots on the left side of the screen, plus have the front screen showing so your subject (especially a child) can see themselves, or you can use the better cameras for selfies. 
Cons-
No dust resistance- I don't bring mine to the beach. 
Keyboards are too big or too small for some people. I do well personally. 
Battery is less than I desire, but with ""Super Fast Charging"" i can power up quickly.

379;14wyo1o;redmantitu;1689167925.0;"had the fold 3 for about 18 months until i upgraded to the S23U this Sunday.

the fold was amazing at the beginning, the inner screen was ""a magical place"" that appeared when you opened the phone...but, with time, i stared to feel that its practicality decreased bit by bit.

the outer screen is too narrow to type on (tried the fold 4, is basically the same feeling even if the screen is a bit wider), the inner screen is too wide.

for watching content, you basically have a smaller screen than the S23U because of the squared form factor.

for web browsing and making research and reading, multitasking with side by side apps, yeah, it is better..but that is about the only (still) great thing about the fold...oh, and the speakers, if you care, are better on the fold.

the battery can't even compare, the S23U being the clear winner, even in front of the fold 4

durability...one day you might wake up, open the phone, and during that, the inner screen might crack...might not happen...but it might...also the hinge can break..not open fully....

so, yeah, S23U is better overall. the fold is better on some niche scenarios...";0
380;14wyo1o;MZero_0;1689102411.0;Coolness factor is definitely something I'm considering, it's just that I heard that some people couldn't open the fold all the way, and that's the last thing I need;0

Movies and a few tv shows have been filmed in 8k for years now as it's easier to do the cgi but them released in 4k so it's only a matter of time before 8k movies are released. Samsung is also working with companies to help kick start it all. For example, the Lord of the Rings show was shot in 8k and briefly shown on Samsungs 8k tvs for people to enjoy";0

464;14ww0z9;ArdaGreat;1689102620.0;If you want a small phone with no compromise in battery the S23 is by far the best. Only other small option would be another flip imo, sonce the base S21 is a little old especially considering battery and S22 is inefficient;0

I do get the occasional comment from my friends, family, or new aquantinces now. Usually along the lines of, ""OMG your phone folds."", or ""Oh yeah, I forgot your phone does that."". But not at the same rate as I used to.

I'm an older gen z and when I was a kid and technology was starting to become more mainstream they taught us all the basic things about it in school, as a result older gen z, millenials and even young gen x are proficient in that department. They taught us the basic skills and it's easy to keep learning from that point and have a basic understandment of how things work.

*It works for around 5 minutes and starts rebooting.*

Picture fizzes out, like it's inverting colour or something, and then goes to Samsung 8k logo that flickers on and off, then goes back to menu and repeat steps.

I tried software update and hard reset. (no change)

I've tried various things. I repasted thermal paste under the heatsink + heatpipes on main cpu board, put small heatsinks on each ram and storage chip. (no change)

I blew fans directly at the back of TV and one connect box. (no change)

I put heatsink on chip inside one connect box. (no change)

I wiggled the cable around to see if there's any loose connection. (no change)

I replugged each connector from mainboard and other components. (no change)

I tested TV with only one of each display ribbons plugged in, and no matter which one I unplug, menu and sound works perfectly normally, no rebooting.

I've ordered a new one connect box and cable, still waiting for those (they accept return if it won't work out).

There's very scarce information out there and absolutely no repair information from anybody, yet, apparently people are getting them repaired by Samsung.

Siri: the most basic of tasks. Open this, send that, check that.

Google Assistant: more complex actions inside of applications. Set this event in the calendar and invite X, Y, and Z. Send them a text 2 hours before as a reminder.

Bixby: leans close to Google assistant but adds hardware control as well since Samsung also makes the hardware themselves. That to me is killer and makes Bixby much more useful. Outside of a Samsung device, it‚Äôs not great but that‚Äôs where Google assistant picks up to keeping the experience consistent.

It doesnt work well with spotify. Even with spotify mentioned, like ""Play The Weekend in Spotify"", it doesn't know I want spotify open.

The real reviewers are the smaller YouTubers who have to milk out the product by doing several update videos of the same product. This is because they don't have as many products sent to them to review and they most likely buy the device with their own money.

But searches being part of the YouTube culture of measuring assistants can't be reversed now. It's weird that mobile assistants are measured on what the Google company is built for -- searches.

Bixby definitely takes the cake, with a rather big gap between any other assistant, when you need a phone assistant, i.e. something that assists you with your mobile device.

Besides, even if your metrics are more geared in such ways, e.g. whether it can hold a conversation or not, whether it converts your question to a correct online search query or not, etc., Bixby is still a solid second place and consistently improving (it was third before).";0

683;14wcuzt;nodakskip;1689042474.0;"I have gotten two phones via samsung dot com. First the S20 Plus then the S22 Plus. I did a trade in with my old S9 for the S20 Plus. I did the payment option through Samsung.  I also used this later to get two Samsung watches. 

For the trade in, after you get the new phone in the mail. You transfer to the new one and erase the old one. Then send it back. After about a week they will email and say that the old trade in phone has been accepted. If its not then they may add on to the cost of the phone you bought. So be sure the old phone is good. 

For payments it was around 25 a month to another bank online site. As long as you got it paid off before the set date then no interest was charged. But if you do not they can charge you a high fee. Also its not automatic. You have to go to the website each month and pay off the payment.  But you can do what I did and pay more then the minimum each month. After you pay it off you do not have to do anything. But make sure the site says balance 0 owed.

I found it kind of easy. I just kept my S22 Plus since I did not think the S23 Plus had anything new. And the Ultra was way too expensive. I am waiting to see what the S24 looks like. 

Also one note I should mention if you do it with the payment plan, and they ship the phone. You will not be able to change the address or anything after it ships. I tied to have it redirected to a local fedex place instead of my building after some mail theft. So I had to wait for it all day to show up.";0

Even with a regular 3A USB cable with the 45w charger, it should still charge at Super Fast Charging speeds (25w) and should fully charge a S23U from flat in slightly over an hour (assuming you're not using it while charging).

It's kind of misleading. Samsung, Google and Apple all basically charge it around 30 watts or less most of the time. The 45 w is a conceptual maximum speed .

It's embarrassing compared to the charging speeds we're seeing in other parts of the world. Vivo, Xiaomi, iqoo, etc... Some people tried to defend it by saying it preserves your battery life long-term but that is silly. Because if you're worried about that you can just buy a slower charger.

752;14w0ye3;Whole-Brilliant5508;1689026265.0;I heard that a'lot of it has to do with the S23 Ultra's screen being quite the power guzzler. For some reason, it doesn't mesh well with the processor chip.;0

777;14v8axf;Hpatas;1688940047.0;They make the screen replacement so much more expensive, especially for me living in Brazil. I had a Note 20 Ultra that I expect getting at least 5 years of use, after 3 the screen started showing some green vertical lines, and the replacement was more than half the price of the new S23+ that I got. I made the deliberate house of getting the plus and not the ultra, because of the curved screen.;0
778;14v8axf;Super_Average00;1688938136.0;I'm in the 10% I guess as I love the curved screen since I had an s7 edge and never really had an issue with them. My issue now is how big these phones are lol. If I could get regular s23 size with ultra screen and features, that would be my choice.;0
779;14v8axf;DrunkenNormal69;1688944852.0;The curved screen when doing photo editing work is actually a really giant pain in the ass. Using my s20 ultra that I still have outside of a case is almost impossible.;0

782;14v8axf;impossibleis7;1688945285.0;"To me, a flat display looks better as well. The curve makes it look like the border width on the two sides are different to the top or the bottom. Makes it feel like the phone has 3 different border widths. Cheapens the phone imo. They used to look good on pre S10 phones, but with the chin, the curve just looks out of place imo (I mean, one ordinary border, two curved, a chin and a hole punch; thats one busy display).";0

785;14v8axf;AntOk463;1688937327.0;"First of all, curved glass is a must. The the edge of the glass needs to be curved, it makes it look so much better and so much more premium. People loved curved glass, my grandma had a very cheap old LG phone that costs like $300 and it had curved glass, it did look a lot better than my uncle's LG phone with flat glass even though it was more expensive. 

Curved screens are debatable, they really don't add much and also don't take much away, and it is a very costly procedure. But again, it makes the experience more premium. They used to have features, like with the S7 and S8, you can have your phone face down and still get information from notifications because the edge display was vertical and not flat.";0
786;14v8axf;MistaKrebs;1688939316.0;I think the curves on the S23 Ultra are great. Makes the phone feel nicer to hold without a case and just makes the phone look nicer.;0

792;14v8axf;metulburr;1688944306.0;"I honestly like them. But I hate them at the same time. I always feel like it's the Achilles' heel of the screen. Especially how the ottorbox recessed the side protection  right near the curves, allowing a perfect sweet spot corner to crack the screen. 

I am always function over appearance. And to me the protection is more important. I will be absolutely livid if I drop my phone and it cracks on the curve. I do have a high quality screen protector on it, but I would rather not test it. But there is still a small gap between the ottorbox rubber and the screen protector. You could in theory hit that exact spot when it's dropped. And if there was no curve, the rubber case would lip so high it wouldn't matter....but it doesn't.

806;14v8axf;hachiko2692;1688937939.0;"Curved screens are actually pretty good.

The main reason is content viewing. You put all that tech into giving the Ultra phones the best screens in the world, so of course implement it to the best of its abilities. Looking at most flat phones, especially if they have a bright colorway on the back, it's distracting to see the side bezels that the curves remove. And if people can complain about thick bezels on phones, I reckon this is also valid.

Another thing I really liked about the curved screens is the smoothness when you use gestures. I went from a Samsung A52s to an S21U, so I experienced both flat and curved. I actually wished Samsung would make a phone that's curved on all four sides.

And for people like me, who use the phone mainly for content viewing, video, livestreams and movies alike, the curved phones offer a superior experience.

And guess what, a lot of people actually view content on their phones now, because chances are, if they have a phone that's at least $300, their phone screen is the **best** screen they have on their household.";0
807;14v8axf;Safe_Opinion_2167;1688939868.0;"Remember the Note Edge? Curved screens started there. It helped the swipe gesture from the edge for displaying the edge panels, and it still is. I feel the gesture is easier on curved screens.

So i was thinking this ain't bad. But the next morning, a piece of the screen just fell off the edge where the crack was.  my whole screen turned off and nothing was responsive.

 I learned that anything that hits the edge even if you have a screen protector on the edge is so weak and fragile... so got a replacement from samsung care a month after 6 calls to samsung care which were operated by some call center in india where you can't even understand what they are saying and was told that they need to put me on hold and i wait 30 minutes on hold just to be hung up on.. this happened multiple times, 

so i started complaining. in email support and was told to give a picture of my identification card and fill out a online form. it took them a week just to review that, and they asked for a video of the phone.. took them a week to look after that. in which i emailed them again... they sent a brand new sealed s23 ultra with 512gb memory.

1037;14vt5l7;InfiniteHall3;1689052664.0;"While I haven't used the S series since S9 lol, one thing I can agree on is the Flip having kinda underwhelming camera. 

Having used both A52/53 and now brought the A54 for a family member, suprisingly the A54 camera isn't far behind the flip. In fact they've very close (camera quality wise.) Ofc the flip4 still have flagship elements like the s8+1 processor so it's gonna process the picture faster and records in 4K60fps (main and selfie cam). But other that, the flip 4 is honestly a bit underwhelming when it technically costs twice as much vs A54. 

Zflip4 has pretty much worse sensors across the board even when compared to standard S21/22/23. So is that why the selfie camera and ultrawide is great in good light but immediately falls apart in lower light üíÄ. I guess the AI & processing can only do so much. Main camera is good though imo (not amazing).

Now to be fair, I brought the flip for just ¬£650 with trade in so I'm not gonna go too harsh for the camera quality. Plus I already knew it won't have the best cameras to begin with. I mainly brought it for the form factor and the ability to take group pictures without needing a tripod. Though sometimes I still wish the flip could've at least used the same main, ultrawide and selfie cameras as the S23 :( even if it lacks telephoto.";0

Hi:
 
Unfortunately, that is normal for the entire HP 15-da0xxx, 15-da1xxx and HP 250 G7 model series.
 
For some reason while NVMe SSD's are supported, they only use two PCIe lanes, so they run at approximately half of their advertised speeds.

Many forum members such as yourself have reported this problem, so there is nothing wrong with your NVMe SSD and there is no way to get all 4 PCIe lanes to work.";0
1075;14w5vaq;cuppaseb;1689059262.0;if i had to guess, the port you're plugging the ssd into doesn't support its full speed. looking at the specs, your laptop seems old, so it's likely its motherboard can't keep up with the newer ssd;1

As I heard, if it has 5 pins before the notch it supports 4 PCIe lanes but I guess hp just bought a full one but didn‚Äôt bother to connect all lanes. The laptop isn‚Äôt really old but Isn‚Äôt new. I guess hp support can confirm if it supports 2 or 4 PCIe lanes.";0

1105;14vf07a;Delmer46;1688953085.0;"I've been using a Flip 3 for a year and have no serious complaints.  I bought it because the folded phone fits easily in any pocket.  That's what I like best about it.  As far as performance goes, I can't see any differences between the Flip 3 and my wife's S22.  One exception is that the Flip's battery life is worse than the S22.  I charge the Flip 3 to 85% and by night it's down to 40%.  There  have been no isues at all with the folding screen.

1107;14vf07a;nFocuss;1688960019.0;I have the flip 3. Been using it for about a year I think. Battery life is rough, and the camera was a step down from my Note 20 ultra for sure, that being said. I love it. It's a great size when it's open and when folded, it fits pretty much anywhere. Huge fan of the design. I'll likely upgrade to another flip model when I'm ready for my next phone.;0

1109;14vf07a;Kon_na;1688974148.0;"I've been using the Flip 4 for 6 months and the quality really surprised me. The battery lasts easily the whole day with normal use, which couldn't be said of my previous phone, the Note 20 Ultra. I even started to use the battery protection, which limits the charge at 85%, because I know the charge will last.

The flip comes with small quality of life improvements I didn't know I needed before I got them. Now I'm considering of only getting the flip models, as long as they keep making them.

My only gripe with the flip is the screen protector, and I hope future models can get rid of it. The crease has developed a small air bubble, which I suspect happened due to the summer heat. But it's not that bad that I still haven't had the need to use the 1 free replacement of the screen protector.";0

 Other than that I hope to never got back to regular candybar phones. Folding is so much nicer to hold and put in pocket. My flip 4 battery has been great. Was an improvement on the s22 ultra I had, mainly because the processor was significantly more efficient. 

I see the flip 5 being a major win, but it still lacks the telephoto lense, if that's something that matters to you.";0
1113;14vf07a;ZilJaeyan03;1688990493.0;"I have a flip 3 with a bad temp sensor that im unwilling to fix( it thought its an easy fix but the temp sensor is actually on the screen itself which is a costly replacement) so i upgraded to s23 ultra, it basically meant that the flip cannot be closed without auto shutting down which meant i used the flip as a candy bar phone for atleast 6 months and in those 6 months where the screen was abused as it was frustrating, constantly open to the elements, tables, pocket sand and dirt, whatever, the plastic screen actually held up great

I dont know why people are so afraid of the screen breaking when mine was abused and it still holds up to this day no dead pixels no green lines no crease breaks, only problem i have is that darn temp sensor

Edit: i still prefer the form factor as it feels really good on the hand, 
battery on the 3 is subpar but i think 4 and 5 is miles better, 
cameras take good pics but aint something to write home about, 
flex mode was a wonder when it worked for me especially for video calls, taking pics, taking videos without a tripod, instant selfie while closed, music control while closed

1114;14vf07a;Amazinglyme298;1689008626.0;"I had the s21 for 2 years and upgraded to the flip 3 for a different experience with a Samsung flip. Cool phone, battery life and camera sucked compared to the s21. Then I traded in the flip 3 for the flip 4 since it was about $100 after the July 2022 galaxy unpacked. Right now the phone is in great working working condition. The screen protector is lifting at the hinge and Samsung care won't replace it. This is what I find most annoying about the phone because it seems like the pre installed screen protector lifts after a period of time and they have said lifting it and not replacing it can destroy the OLED panel. So since its under warranty will go elsewhere for a free screen protector replacement. I hope in the future they figure out something better with those pre installed screen protectors. And thats something you don't have to worry about on the S line.

I really want a better camera since I already had been using the s line for so many years. So depending on galaxy unpacked if the flip 5 has a better camera and some additional upgrades I will get the 5 if not I will get the s23 plus and revisit the flip line whenever they decide to better improve the camera. The galaxy flip 5 already looks very good and I honestly love the flip since it can fit in my pocket and small handbags. It's definitely hard to choose between flip 5 and s23. S23 is better if you want the best camera, better battery life but if the small size and being able to flip is more of your feel then the flip 5 will be good. After galaxy unpacked you will be able to decide which one";0
1115;14vf07a;Puzzleheaded-Diet-12;1689010380.0;"Well it depends what your needs are. They both have the same chipset I believe which means running games won't be an issue if you're into gaming. 

1) The s23+ screen will probably be slightly wider than the flip 5 so it'll be more comfortable viewing for gaming or watching videos. That's not saying the flips are bad but if you like wide phones, s23+ might be better for u

2) S23+ also has a telephoto zoom lense which is better quality for if you like taking photos. Z flip 5 is rumoured to not have this and only have main and ultra wide cameras.

3) Flip 5 is more compact and lighter whilst also being unique (u won't get bored as easily with it) , just has a few drawbacks like the telephoto lens. 

4) I heard z flip 4 battery was decent and hopefully this more efficient new chip will make battery life even better for flip 5. S23+ and flip 5 are said to have the same size battery so battery life could be similar as same chip+ battery size.

5) flip 5 is set to have larger cover screen covering almost the full surface area of the back top half panel and will be like a folder shape. 

6) because it flips, it takes more effort to open it than just picking up a regular phone so this could stop you from being distracted by the phone, though the new cover screen size could bring more features.

Hope that's helpful :)";0

Upgraded to s23u this year and have been happy since. The form factor of flip is amazing but the downside of a screen that can stop working at any time without any fault of your own is a risk you need to consider.

Half a year ago I dropped it and couldn't open it fully anymore, but samsung repaired it for free easy. In my country all devices have 2 year warranty so if anything, I know I'm covered for at least another year. 


Overall, the phone is fragile and after I broke it for the first time, it made me quite worried to fold it as carelessly as i did before. But apart from that, it looks cool and I enjoy using it.";0

Battery also is an issue for me such that I play mobile games and while it has enough power to run because of the snapdragon chipsets it does run the battery quickly especially with the smaller size. 

I think for me too if they can add faster charging speeds and adding a bit more battery space, I'll take those over camera improvements. Although I am looking forward for the outerscreen to mature and evolve more as a secondary secondary full function screen while maintaining battery life.";1

- I love the flipping. Its very satisfying!
- I have no issues with the battery. Yes I charge it every evening (its about 40% then), that doesn‚Äôt bother me. 
- The folding comes in handy once in a while to take group pictures. Also when setting a few minute timer.
- The little front screen is just so nice. It doesn‚Äôt do very much. But just for the time, step counter, messages‚Ä¶ very easy access. 
- No performance issues (when playing Wild Rift, Youtube/social splitscreen, Pok√©mon Go‚Ä¶)
- I dropped mine in a pool, and no problem at all!

What does bother me a little is;
- it collects dust a lot. I like my phone clean, but because of the slightly raised bezels it sometimes gets really dusty in my opinion. 
- the camera is ok. Perfect for everything, but from a ‚Ç¨1000+ phone it just feels meh. 
- very sleek design, but the cases make it feel a bit bulky.

At this point, if my Flip 4 breaks, i would go for another fliplike phone. But I can see myself change in favor of specs-money ratio.";0
1133;14vf07a;sfw_sfw_sfw_sfw;1689003435.0;Had the flip 3 before switching to the S23U. Love the form factor and being able to watch videos while using the base as a stand. However had issues with the camera showing lines (fixed with warrenty) and the display not working when unfolding it (almost to the dot after a year later). Wanted to charge me 400 bucks to replacd the screen. So now my flip is an expensive paper weight. I would suggest waiting out a little to see if there any issues with the folding display before pulling the trigger. Flip is a fun phone to use with the cameras good enough for me. However battery life was an issue as it would only last me roughly about 2/3 of my day with a little gaming (20 minutes), Spotify and random browsing on RiF. It's a fun phone to use but has a slight hassle of opening the phone to reply to messages which I have a lot. If the flip 5 is similar to the razr + then that would be amazing.;0

When I bought my S23, the shop quite literally put an iPhone 12 screen protector on my phone (they don't have S23/22 screens), and upon trying to register my fingerprint, it could not scan my finger at all.

-sometimes it's actually very quick and accurate, especially when locking/unlocking quickly, but when the phone is been in standby for a while, it's more likely not to work well;

From mobile devices, home appliances and TV's, it's almost impossible now for me to look at a Samsung product without a healthy dose of skepticism.  And it's not just the issues we have had lately with Samsung products but the utter lack of support available.

Example: We have issues with both a washer and refrigerator that have existed since they were only months old and no one will touch them.  Samsung says they can't find anyone to work on them and now say that our warranty has expired and nothing they can do.  I looked up two different appliance repair shops on the Samsung site and called them myself.

Not to change the subject but has anyone seen actual sales numbers in the US for the S23 lineup?  I haven't.  I see a lot of bragging in other coutries about huge sales numbers but not so much in the US.  Is it because the rest of the world finally had a chance at a Snapdragon chip vs the dreaded Exynos but those in the US that had Snapdragon's all along aren't all that impressed and/or simply think the S23 isn't worth the cost?  You can count me in the latter group.

Having owned Note's since their inception, the S23 line may be ""all that"" in regards to specs but at what point does it become overkill for the majority of users and ends up being more about ""flash"" (pun intended), better specs ""on paper"" and positive press reviews than anything else?  Kinda like the average internet user going on and on about their ""gigabit fiber"".   Very few actually ""need"" that much bandwidth.

I am not disputing the notion that the S23 isn't a great device, because it may be but since it offers me little of what I need and most of what I don't, it isn't on my list.  I yearn for the days when the device I pulled out of the box was all I needed, didn't require hundreds more in chargers, screen protectors, cases, etc.  I long for a device once again that ""dared to be different"" and gave one choices vs. always trying to shoehorn you into an ecosystem and cared more about looking pretty than actually being an ""all in one"" device.

I personally have been holding my nose since the 9/10 days solely due to the lack of anything enticing enough to upgrade.   For me, the latest flagships offer me less and less of what I really need with each passing year.  Having owned 8 different Samsung flagships over the years, and over 20 in our family.  I find the latest interations of the Samsung flagships to be the most restrictive, ecocentric and unnecessary overkill yet, all in the name of flash over function.  Whether that's inticing to one, may not be to another.  Ironically, many of the same reasons I never wanted an iPhone are why I am no longer considering a Samsung flagship for my next device.

I was worried that having waited until the new ones were almost out I was jumping the gun, but I have a GW5 Pro which I got using a combination of deals and trade-ins for about $200 and it works incredibly well. The notifications on your wrist are life-changing, and the fitness and health tracking functions are unbelievably useful. I did not wear a smart watch for three to four years before buying this one (I previously wore Galaxy Gear 3 for a short time, and a Basis Band before that) and now I'm very happy I did. The physical dial isn't a game changer to me and I don't miss it; I like touch better. I don't think the processor upgrade is worth waiting for personally, as it's not that much faster or more efficient, but since the new ones are launching soon, you might get good deals that way. Either one will work really well.";0

The 5 Pro is *great* IMO, and I use it like you mentioned you want to.  Just to have notifications at a glance and track workouts.  Having to only charge it 2 times per week is game-changing, and I hope they never stop making a high-capacity watch!  I probably won't upgrade just for the physical bezel either, and IMO it's not worth the price difference for what you can get a 5 Pro at nowadays.";0

The fact that most of the market adapted is proof that they've done the correct bet. 

I understand your side when it comes to the removal of the 3.5mm jack, but consumers would rather have features like ANC and no cables when they're on the go, which is not possible with 3.5mm. 

As for the SD card, they're not a secure form of storage, and offer lower performance compared to internal storage. Moreover, storage sizes these days are large enough where an SD card is not needed. Transfer speeds are also fast, so hotswapping SD cards are a thing of the past for phones.

Also, I assume that you're an Android user, so your points are completely invalidated since high-end options with the SD card, 3.5mm, and no notch/holepunch exist. So I don't get your complain, why not buy those phones?

Completely removing those components via root is fair. I also hate it when companies include excessive bloat in their phones. I'm tired of chasing SafetyNet though, so I've resorted to voting with my wallet buying phones with minimal bloat.";0

Plenty of reasons to go by, but the most important is that even if you have an 8K capable display there is no broad availability of 8K content and by the time it becomes broadly available your TV will be considered a dinosaur. Meanwhile, 8K is very expensive, so to bring down the price to a 4K TV means that the 8K one is completely stripped of features whereas the 4K is packed with features to have a price close to that of the 8K. In the next 5 years a 4K packed with features will serve you much better than an 8K that will display 4K at best and have no features. Don't bother with 8K until at least 2028. Case closed.

Something else now. Depending on viewing distance as well, but 4K 65' and 8K 65' are barely distinctive in the human eye, so I don't even know what is the point of 8K in below at least 75' size. Would you want an 8K display on your phone even if it was for free? 4K on your phone at this size and distance is already an overkill of an overkill.";0

For the longest time I was an andriod user, moved to Apple, back to Samsung with the S8+ then back onto Apple with 11 & 13. As the 15 line-up approches, I'm wanting some longevity out of the phone. I'm tried of contracts etc. so I'm thinking about buying outright. 

I've been looking at rumours for the new 15 Pro line and comparing it to the S23 Ultra as I want a flagship that will last me.

As someone who isn't locked in the Apple Ecosystem (I have an iPad Mini 6 but a windows computer), is looking at the S23 Ultra a smart move?

I've been looking at reviews both on this subreddit and online and they always talk about the apple ecosystem.. but I'm in the UK and have Whatsapp.. What if I'm not locked in?

Some of the reviews for the S23 Ultra having been turning my head especially with the whole andriod customerisation and also the fact you can get *certain* apps on andriod whereas the iPhone you need to jailbreak. I have a garmin watch, andriod devices.

Can you still load launchers into Samsungs? Are they recommended? 

Let me know if you want to know more. I know there will be a huge bias in this subreddit but I'm hoping there's people who have moved from Apple to Samsung with the S23 lineup";0

I use Samsungs systems to look up the imei for support and it never works, I‚Äôve had to contact support every single time and they don‚Äôt ever tell me the imei doesn‚Äôt exist, but they don‚Äôt give any more info than what I‚Äôve already provided here.

This can‚Äôt be a fake phone as it was purchased directly from Verizon. We purchased care plus because we encountered this EXACT SAME experience on her last phone and just ended up upgrading. We previously didn‚Äôt have care plus and figured paying the extra would give us premium support.

NOT EVEN CLOSE.

The last conversation I had with a tech was him giving me a support number and telling me support will get a hold of me. It‚Äôs been a month now and nothing.

I‚Äôve contacted Samsung literally at least 4 or 5 times for just this singular issue on this particular phone and I‚Äôve had the EXACT same experience before.

1610;14u72z9;Useful-Math4418;1688832072.0;"S23 all the way, 
I'm not a samsung fanboy so this opinion is not baised.
G2 chip is just not worth it at 70k and in my opinion one UI is better than the pixel UI, one UI has a bit of bloatware but u can always delete them so no worries about that.
One UI has way more customisation options than pixel UI.
I recently bought a54, I loved one plus 11r but the software is yuk after it got merged with Vivos colour os ü´•... So I ended up buying a54 although is shit at everything except camera when compared to 11r, the UI is just mwaaahh ü§åüèª.
So yeah u won't have any problem with the UI, u will love it.
Cameras are amazing in both of the phones so dw about that too.
The processor is fast as fuck boi.
If u want a better battery life I would suggest to go with s23 plus but s23 has amazing battery life too.

Go for s23 bud.

Edit : u won't notice the difference in qhd and fhd between the 2 phones as s23 is 6.1 inch display and the pixel density is high, samsung displays are always the best in the world when it comes to colours n amoled contrast.";0
1611;14u72z9;fmtn00;1688851131.0;"Can't say much about the Pixel since I don't have it but I watched ton of reviews comparing phones before I got my S23.

All I can say is that the pictures are amazing, really good, and I'd probably say even better than the Pixel (but just from the reviews on YT so IDK). So far not disappointing. Videos are great too, and the zoom is surprising by how good it is.

Battery wise, it will depend on your usage. I am a heavy user, play lots of games and take many pictures, much scrolling on medias etc. So far not disappointed about it. It holds well, I have to charge more often when I use it hard but otherwise, not really, I feel confident enough to live my day without thinking about the battery. When I play hours of games, it drops heavily but that's normal (I play at max performance) but it holds up well. 
If you are a ""normal"" user, it will last you all day or close to it. 
When I do normal stuff on it, I don't even think about the battery.

Android versions. Samsung has made progress on this aspect, it is on the newest android version, newest OneUI and will have updates for longer than the Pixel (this is what is said as to now. We'll see if Google changes that in the future).

So, for me, the only ""plus"" the Pixel has is the size, and it depends heavily on whether you prefer a bigger or smaller phone. I love big phones (I had the Note 9) and was kind of afraid of getting the small s23, but I got used to it very quickly, now I find it the perfect size for everyday usage.

I'll say, the other thing that could favor the Pixel is if you prefer stock Android or OneUI. I really think OneUI is superior, more beautiful and more stuff to do with it. But that is my opinion. You have to look for yourself which one you prefer. 

But both are great phones. If you can have them for the same price, I'd say take the S23.";0
1612;14u72z9;LiterallyZeroSkill;1688870025.0;"I recently got a Galaxy S23U and still have my Pixel 7 Pro.

They both have pros and cons. I'll lay it out as I see it:

Galaxy S23U:

- Better battery life
- Better fingerprint scanner
- Better screen brightness
- Better video recording


Pixel 7 Pro:

- Better camera in just about all conditions
- Cleaner/Better UI with smoother animations
- Faster updates with better updating method
- AI features I think are better on Pixel


That's how I see it broadly. If I had to buy only one with knowing what I know now, I'd buy the Pixel 7 Pro. But decide what's important to you OP and go in that direction.";0
1613;14u72z9;lligerr;1688833314.0;Go for S23. Pixel is more buggy and their videos are Inferior to S23. One UI also has got more features. You get the best of both Google+Samsung. In terms of performance, S23 is way ahead;0

1616;14u72z9;_pinksky_;1688877021.0;"Even if you leave practicality out of it, I think S23 is much much more of the all rounder. Cameras are great, the camera is closer to the ultra version than any other previous versions i.e except for the zoom I think you'll get similar looking pictures in all aspects, even videos.

In Performance SD 8gen2 is undeniably better...like no doubt. Better optimised so, the phone doesn't really heat up or get that warm tbh and delivers good battery life.. enough to last you for a day or maybe a Lil more on medium to heavy usage. Tensor G2 is just an okay okay chip that's designed to do regular tasks, i think the phone heats up as well. If you're gonna do gaming and multi-tasking and such the S23 is much superior in that regard.  It gives you s23U level performance so in that aspect it's a no brainer.

The screen res is honestly not going to matter much, you're barely gonna be able to tell the difference. Samsung screens are great either ways with good colours so trust me you won't notice much of a difference.

Now you'll get more security/OS updates for s23, soo much more customisation options and tweaks you can do to play around with your phone which is always fun to have, OneUI is great, it's arguably the best skin in Android, the perfect middle ground I'd say.
And btw I've heard the service for pixel in India is not that great.
Now if you really really want a pixel I'd say wait for pixel8/8 pro because they will be revealed pretty soon and make your decision.

1620;14u72z9;miney_mo;1688833099.0;"S23 simply because it excels on all the fronts. Pixel's cameras are great but so are of the s23, infact samsung takes better pictures of human subjects compared to the grainy oversharpened & dark pics that pixel takes (see videos - gyan therapy, techwiser etc). 

Also, One UI is simply great! It is, arguably, the best android UI out there and while people tend to refer to Samsung's apps as bloat, I really like them. They are better designed than google's own apps and if you use them, you will actually start liking them. You can always debloat the phone.

If you have windows pc, samsung's quick share is also now available for all laptops.

Battery backup should be similar on both. The only thing you need to consider is the screen size, s23 is very compact while pixel 7p is a chungus. Also, it is easier to find tempered glass for flat screens compared to curved on the pixel.";0

That one issue can change how someone will continue to view a pixel product. YouTubers and people who make reviews about them in articles shy away from such topics bc they want the pixel to look good, and some of them don't flat out by the phone themselves, pixel gives them a review unit.

Yeah, it does it all, call, text, photos, ft, yeah. That's the point of what all basic phones do. It's a mid tier phone. You can't expect the holy grail and tbh I think the a54 performs better than the SE. I've seen people clock some serious screen on time without gaming and with gaming. Yes that varies per user as every single phone does. 

You have both 60hrz and 120hrz which is all great for you! But people who'd like to stay on budget, have a ""flagship"" feeling of an experience without punching the price too high they can get that with other brands and Apple will never do such a thing. That's the most important part about that. The SE is already such an old outdated look, even at Apple's standards and they should've went with the look of the XR and with a similar color palette variety if they needed that phone to sell bigger numbers, but of course, people who use that phone and isn't a tech junkie or a tech enthusiast like myself would only get it bc it's the perfect space of staying with Apple bc your friends and staying on an Apple budget. That budget will only scrape that low for Apple is their ipads lol. 

You can get a 7a, but will it perform the way it should? No, not at all. Why? It's because it varies person to person, and because of the use cases, it will be underperforming, we all know that.

1767;14tp7bd;mistermojorizin;1688836639.0;my pixel XL and pixel 4a 5g both died because of something hardware related. google had built up some good will with me because they upgraded my nexus 7P to the pixel XL for free, because lots of people were having hardware problems with the N7P (not me though). Since then, Google support got a lot worse. They removed the free google photos storage. I got the S23+, my first Samsung since the Galaxy Nexus (which also had hardware problems with the screen). First big thing I'm noticing is the S23+ doesn't have a hard fingerprint reader (but neither do newer Pixels). Also, camera is not as good as the Pixel XL (a 2016 phone, if I remember right) nor the P4A5g (which shared the same camera hardware with the Pixel XL). The best phone I had was probably Pixel 2XL or before that the Motorola Droid Max (vanilla software, insane battery, carrier version was rootable, lasted me like 4 yrs). Anyway, in my experience Pixels have great software and cameras, but unreliable hardware. I'm not sure about Samsung yet since s23+ is my first modern Samsung. I guess I'll know in a few years, but for now not too happy about the camera hardware/camera app and that you can't get voicemail in the phone app and that there's duplicate apps that can't be disabled. I do like how fast it is and since it's my first phone with 8gb ram it's pretty amazing how long it holds apps in memory.;0

Apple was proud to put a new chip in an outdated body in an old screen, their ""budget phone"", and surprisingly that sold more than the iphone mini(s) of course. 

There's people out there who want more, who don't want an iphone, and don't want the struggles of Pixel, and in America that only option was Samsung, but now there's Asus and Nothing (even though they don't make smaller phones they stay under or near $500+ price point).

Iphones will always have a respectable share in the market mainly because of people my age and not towards the older adults (no offense to anyone). That's their market, tech enthusiast, and teens.

1859;14uais8;fmtn00;1688839860.0;"Can't say much about the Pixel since I don't have it but I watched ton of reviews comparing phones before I got my S23.

All I can say is that the pictures are amazing, really good, and I'd probably say even better than the Pixel (but just from the reviews on YT so IDK). So far not disappointing. Videos are great too, and the zoom is surprising by how good it is.

Battery wise, it will depend on your usage. I am a heavy user, play lots of games and take many pictures, much scrolling on medias etc. So far not disappointed about it. It holds well, I have to charge more often when I use it hard but otherwise, not really, I feel confident enough to live my day without thinking about the battery. When I play hours of games, it drops heavily but that's normal (I play at max performance) but it holds up well. 
If you are a ""normal"" user, it will last you all day or close to it. 
When I do normal stuff on it, I don't even think about the battery.

Android versions. Samsung has made progress on this aspect, it is on the newest android version, newest OneUI and will have updates for longer than the Pixel (this is what is said as to now. We'll see if Google changes that in the future).

So, for me, the only ""plus"" the Pixel has is the size, and it depends heavily on whether you prefer a bigger or smaller phone. I love big phones (I had the Note 9) and was kind of afraid of getting the small s23, but I got used to it very quickly, now I find it the perfect size for everyday usage.

I'll say, the other thing that could favor the Pixel is if you prefer stock Android or OneUI. I really think OneUI is superior, more beautiful and more stuff to do with it. But that is my opinion. You have to look for yourself which one you prefer. 

But both are great phones. If you can have them for the same price, I'd say take the S23.

Edit : grammar";0
1860;14uais8;Minimum_Leadership51;1688929046.0;"I had a pixel 7pro until 2 weeks ago when switching to the S23+. What can I say, I have mixed feelings about the pixel. While the camera was arguably better, the rest of the phone wasn't. Not a single thing. On the other hand, it's not A LOT worse, but there are some things like battery life or finger print reader that'll make a difference in day-to-day use. What was the final reason for me to change was that I couldn't apply a proper screen protection due to the edges of the display and well...I had a cracked screen after the first time it fell.

Edit: The price of the pixel was slightly lower, so that's a pro, I guess.";0
1861;14uais8;Pretend_Tooth_965;1688846183.0;They are actually two different animals. Pixel is 'keep it simple stupid' and Samsung is 'every option and the kitchen sink'.  I have both a P6P and an S22U and alternate my SIM in each because I still can't decide.;0
1862;14uais8;Generalrossa;1688948087.0;Keep in mind the pixel 7 pro has battery life and heating issues. The issues all over everywhere so it won't be hard to research.;0
1863;14uais8;bop426;1688957129.0;I had a P7P and had the green screen display failure. I got a replacement from Google and sold it. I was leery of the issue recurring. I still like Pixels and got a 7a. I also bought an S23U. It's a great phone but too big and heavy for me. I sold that and got an S23+. I like it a lot. Battery life is excellent as is the display, the UI and size/shape. The Pixels have a slight edge on photos but the Samsungs are close. I can't decide which I want so I decided that I'd have both. I don't have any expensive hobbies otherwise. Right now if I had to pick one I'd keep the S23+ (or S23). The Pixel 8 may change that. It never ends...;0
1864;14uais8;inventord;1688848776.0;TBH I would go for a Pixel 7 Pro. It's a better, more well-rounded device, and IMO it really comes down to how much the extra android update matters to you (the speed difference shouldn't be noticable, and stock android has really nice animations). Both are good devices either way though.;0
1865;14uais8;EliteMuffen1;1688839817.0;I'm personally a fan of the S23, I'd get the S23+ if you can, but you also can't go wrong with the Pixel 7 pro either,  it all comes down to personal preferences really;0

1882;14u3bb5;darkturtleforce;1688838081.0;It's the carriers. When you carrier unlock a phone that was previously locked to a carrier, sometimes it disables wifi calling and volte/HDvoice. If you can flash the unlocked software version onto the phone, it restores those functions. Not sure if that's an option on the s20, careful you don't brick the phone if you've never done it. Last time this happened to me it was with an s7 and you could still flash software relatively easily but I think they locked down the bootloader more since then.;0

If you have ¬£500 I would recommend not going for a Samsung laptop but going for a different brand like a HP or an Asus with at least an i5 

Most of the money your paying for the Samsung ones goes on optimization, screen, keyboard ect not so much on the raw power of the machine.

The 2200 is actually the more powerful and efficient chip. But generally, when it comes to gaming, since the 8 Gen 1 is more widely used it is therefore more optimised by games.

I also have an S1, Tab 7.2 (2011), S3, S5, and Note3, and they are still working perfectly.

Not major things, but one u.i's animations are the most noticeable in that regard as certain elements like the swipe down toggle, charging animation, and *especially* the samsung pay quick toggle can feel junky.

It doesn't personally bother me very much because of all the o.s's samsungs one u.i is so feature packed and functional it really makes me not want to use any other system, but as far a premium feel I'd argue google's stock android and apples Ios feel more refined with the cost of samsungs functionality.";0

Especially when you go do something and it's linking to a calendar and you are prompted with ""which of the 2 do you wanna do this function with"" even if the only solution was Samsung's apps that's fine too but it isn't the case and it's annoying to me.";1
1989;14szxry;Dismal-Door-7061;1688751114.0;OneUI is quite good.  Samsung just needs to can it with Bixby.;0
1990;14szxry;LiterallyZeroSkill;1688760889.0;"I personally like the Pixels UI more.

There are things about the Samsung UI that just feels like it's not that well thought out and unfinished:

-The folders not resizing to the number of apps you have in it.

-The icons in the folders not filling out the folder icon.

-The app drawer not resetting back to page one when you leave the app drawer.

-When you delete all apps/widgets from a home screen and it's completely empty, it doesn't auto delete, so you'll have a home page that's just sitting there empty.

-When sorting apps in the app drawer in alphabetical order, folders are always at the front even if I rename them to 'Z'.

-When I'm in an app and swipe up to get the multi tasking menu, it will move away from the current app and go to a previous app. But when I'm on the phone screen and swipe up to the multitasking menu, it'll go directly to the last app I used and not to the left. It's inconsistent behaviour.

-For work profiles, it won't let you change keyboards. I don't want Samsung's keyboards but can't swap to any other.

-Certain apps open with half the screen wasted. For example, Google Messages, when I open the app, I only start seeing messages half way down the screen and the top half is empty.

Then there's just the usual smoothness of it which isn't as smooth as the Pixel to me. Pixel has nicer, smoother animations and like design cues that to me are more polished. The large icons in the notification shade on the Pixel I thought were a waste of space, but then I grew to appreciate them and now that I'm back on Samsung, I prefer the larger notification shade icons of the Pixel. 

It's just a preference thing, but coming back to Samsung, I do like the Pixel UI a lot more.";0

Honestly they should just integrate the required apps and have them remain up to date. I don't think I've ever installed anything other than the epic games engine and Fortnite from the galaxy store. Besides watch themes.

2132;14tvn8s;blujay40;1688816595.0;"Well, I own and still use both a Note 8 and Note 10+.  Can't speak for what other's experience may be but here's mine.

I took out both S Pen's and they appear to be the same size, shape, etc.  I then inserted each into the opposite phone and although both went into the slot without issues and each recognized the other's S Pen upon insertion, neither would ""lock"" up into the slot so the the end of the S Pen was flush with the outer band.  The flat end/nub stuck out just enough on both so one could get a fingernail behind it and easily pull it out with almost no resistance where when each is in their proper device, the flat end/nub was flush with the outer band and I couldn't get a nail or anything else in there to try and pull it out without the normal push/pull process.

So although it appears that the 10+ S pen will ""work"" with the Note 8 in a functional manner (and vise versa), the S Pen end sticking out just enough to get a nail behind it also would most likely be an issue in a pocket, purse, etc., where something could catch the end of the S Pen and easily pull it out.

I'm planning on trading down to a regular s9 this year.

It's a superb tablet. Frankly, it's just so much better than an ipad, imo.

Personally, I find the ultra too big for travel (trying to use it in an economy plane seat is cumbersome). But then, I use it as a tablet, I don't work on it much.

And that brings up the other main issue. It's soooo close to being a replacement to a laptop. But yet, so far away. Android holds it back.

The mobile versions of apps like Microsoft office suck compared to their windows counterparts. And every once in a while, I need to run an exe program, and can't.

2238;14t13ab;_marcoos;1688777493.0;">how do I know which is a flagship

By the letter in the model name.

* Z series - flagship foldables, international; currently: Z Fold 4, Z Flip 4
* W series - flagship foldables for the People's Republic of China; an almost exact clone of the Z series, but with software adjusted to match what the Communist Party wants; some additional bling added. Current models: W23 (Z Fold 4 equivalent), W23 Flip (Z Flip 4 equivalent);
* S series - flagship slab phones, currently: S23/S23+/S23 Ultra; except:
* S FE (previously S Lite) series - ""flagship killers"", how much they differ from the same-numbered flagship S models varies (the most recent model of this series is the S21 FE, which is literally just a slightly smaller S21+; but the upcoming S23 FE is rumored to be much worse than any of the real S23s and based on what appears to be the internals of a European Exynos-based S22)
* A series - from totally low-end devices (A0x Core, A0x)  via lower-midrange (A1x, A2x, A3x) to upper-midrange (A5x/A7x), current models are A04 Core/A04/A04s/A14/A24/A34/A54. The higher the first digit is, the better.
* M series - take an A series model, possibly put a bigger battery in it (but not always), do some random minor changes to it, put less care about the build quality, the result is an M series. The caveat is: M series software support timespan is much shorter than in the A series. The original idea here was to have cheap phones only sold online (Xiaomi-style), but you can get them in physical shops now too, so I'm not really sure why this line-up exists at all.FWIW, the M54 seems to be a better device than the A54 (if you ignore the shorter support timespan).
* F series - basically, selected M series models but sold by Flipkart in India.

Any other single letters in the model name (e.g. ""Galaxy J"") are deprecated.

There's also the XCover line-up, which is like an upper midrange A series, but rugged.

Basically, anything that isn't a Z, a W nor an S is either a mid-range or low-end device.";0
2239;14t13ab;KidKitzman;1688832814.0;I just replaced my S9, but it's still quite reliable and probably faster than half of the phones I sell. The main reason I even replaced it is because the battery dies much faster than it used to. Sure, the Z Fold 3 I got is much faster, but the S9 is still completely competent in today's environment. Very glad I went with Samsung.;0
2240;14t13ab;giaphox;1688750148.0;Same. From a fellow N20U user, I love my phone so much, the camera is amazing in almost every way, except the zooming, but that's ok.;0
2241;14t13ab;Dafiro93;1688736513.0;I wouldn't call the A13 a mid tier, that's more like entry tier.  A mid tier would be something like the A54 which costs a bit over $400 and actually has pretty good performance for the price.;0

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

So if you live in the USA, you might not get the watch you preordered until almost a month later, at end of august, but rest of the world receives theirs usually a few days after announcement, I am in Europe for example.

Google Wallet/Pay has this thing if your phone is unlocked, you hold it up to a terminal, and Google Wallet/Pay activates automatically (I consider this a huge security risk) with Samsung you have to open the app and either fingerprint or PIN to activate the card to pay, also a 50 second timer is activated after that it deactivates paying

Also, I am in Canada, and my bank is TD Canada Trust (TD Bank Canada), and they only support Apple and Samsung Wallet/Pay";1
2332;14su01r;Thick_Examination520;1688698738.0;"It entirely depends what your social surroundings are. If more people use Google Pay, and more shops prefer Google Pay more than Samsung Pay, you should prefer Google Pay if you are unbiased between both apps.

However, I use Samsung Pay here in India since it is compatible with nearly all the major players and is inbuilt in my phone. There are some reasons for it:

(1.) I noticed reward coins in Samsung Pay much more than that in Google Pay.

(2.) Samsung Pay allows me to add a PayTM wallet inside it. So I don't need to input my Bank PIN whenever I make a transaction.

(3.) Samsung Pay is more battery efficient on Samsung phones. Google apps always run in the background whichever phone you use.

(4.) Samsung Pay allows me to store my important documents within the app, inside Samsung Wallet.

(5.) I can access Samsung Pay using just a swipe-up from bottom of the screen, from any screen, even from lock screen.

These were my honest observations after using nearly all of the payment apps on a Galaxy. My priorities include speed, features and battery life.

The s23 or s23 plus are good but a bit expensive but will last 3-4 years. The s21 fe is a better phone then the a54. But it's a bit older and a harder recommend but it is a better phone.

The only complain I have is that the touch sensitivity feels weir sometimes but nothing that affects my usage. I attribute the issue to the tempered glass screen protector";0

I got my S23 256gb with 2 yr contract for 20 Euro a month for 430 Euro. 
Since you are Eu I retract my recommendations for s22 as a decent phone as the exynos is ultra bad. But you have the redmagic Eu warehouse and online store. I got the the redmagic 8 for 650 Euro and it smashes the s23 Ultra which I had. The only place it gets beat is the camera as the redmagic is mediocre but decent.

2426;14spjk6;Generalrossa;1688720794.0;"True it does have the 888 in it. Do some research first because I have heard that the battery is bad but that's most likely the Exynos version. But do your research as I could be wrong.

2428;14spjk6;Pennywise8690;1688723894.0;Yes I was using the S20 FE for about a month while I was waiting for my upgrade as my previous phone died on me. Never had issues with it. It's fast and decent camera I gave it to my son. He loves it!;0
2429;14spjk6;__ManBearPig___;1688718405.0;"Oh, a hard NO NO...looking at specs, it seems as a great choice but S21fe is plagued with touch issues. They arr hardware so no fix. Just trust me and stay away from the it. You can search the net about the issue but it was a huge problem.

Also, with regards to performance not really since they all perform about the same in day to day and are snappy enough for your requirements. Cameras are deffinitely better than a54 but the touch issues trump that. S22 has bad ish battery life but imo still decent and you can fins it in the 500 600 price range.";0
2430;14spjk6;MusaaKhan;1688807202.0;I have the Exynos S21 FE, it's a really good phone and the battery is okayish (I can get 5h of SOT with all the features turned on). From what I've read online the SD 888 and Exynos 2100 are both equally good or bad in the battery department, that can also be said for phone with SD 8 Gen 1. I'd get the S21 FE if I were you honestly. Way better cameras, processor, etc. Only drawback when compared to the A54 would be the battery. And I can also guarantee the phone won't lag or give hiccups down the years and it was also get software updates till 2026-27 (Android 16).;0
2431;14spjk6;__ManBearPig___;1688721696.0;that depends on the seller. I woudnt touch a s21 fe with a 20 foot pole. I started a chat with you on reddit as that would be faster if you want write there. 840 is from all those overpiced stores i found random sites in sweden for around 7000 kr;1

2442;14t8xdd;_marcoos;1688776359.0;"Yes and no, that depends on whether your country's carriers are as deranged as (some of?) the American ones and whether they have whitelists/blacklists of devices they support (and consider ""phones"") and not.

If your carriers are not deranged, everything should work fine; tablets and phones conceptually really only differ in the screen size, the internals are the same (of course, bar performance, camera quality and other obvious differences between the Tab A7 Lite and phones like A54 or the S/Z series).

The (Samsung) Phone app is there and works fine, both with incoming and outgoing calls. I used to make some calls from my S7 FE, it went fine. You can also install Google's variant of that if you prefer that. Same with both companies Messages apps.

What will not work:

* Samsung Health, Samsung Health Monitor and the plugin for the Galaxy Watch will not show up in the Play Store nor in the Galaxy Store (because Samsung believes you shouldn't pair a watch with a tablet). You may try sideloading them, but I'm not sure if that'll work.  
Not sure how other health trackers and smart watch integration apps work with a tablet, I've only ever had a GW.
* Samsung Themes don't work on tablets because Samsung doesn't want them to
* You may potentially have problems with banking apps. Here in Poland some banks ban their apps from what they consider tablets. Your bank in Brazil may do so, or not, your mileage may vary, I have no way of telling that.

So, assuming your carrier doesn't ban the Tab A7 Lite, it will generally work as a phone for you. Just with some apps possibly being unavailable due to bullshit reasons.";0

I made an iCloud backup on my iPhone later which took 5 hours, but didn't let me create a password, and still Smart Switch didn't work. When I search online, it tells me to encrypt my backup through a MacOS on their Finder or iTunes app, but I don't have a Mac.

How the hell am I supposed to transfer my iPhone data to my S23? I don't have any encrypted backups despite Smart Switch prompting me for an encrypted backup password, I'm unable to make an encrypted backup and a password for it since I don't have a MacOS, none of the possible common passwords I use worked, and I don't get any answers from googling. The two phones are already connected with a cable, what am I supposed to do in order to transfer my data?";0
2471;14t2sgn;MrMcGreenGenes;1688744648.0;"**Galaxy Watch 5 Pro LTE connection drops audio stream when display goes into Standby**

I've contacted Samsung support about this and their recommendation was to reset the device, which I don't believe is going to help. Everything else is working, all diagnostic tests pass, and the problem does not occur if connected to the phone by BT or on WiFi. Speedtest on LTE results show 8Mb+ which should be plenty for 64Kbps audio streams.

iHeart app buffers heavily for several minutes and eventually levels out, but changing to a different station starts it over and usually crashes the app, requiring it or the watch to be restarted. MP3 streams launched from the Internet browser stop working as soon as the screen dims, and turning AOD on does not help.

Haven't gotten a beta invite for the update or I'd be providing feedback about this issue there.

2475;14t2sgn;ralmt;1688777173.0;"Samsung tag not resetting

Hi, I've had three Samsung tags for a year with no problems and then all of a sudden last week they disconnected and it flashed up that I had three unknown tags following me. I've tried contacting support through smartthings but they've stopped replying.

Each time I reset the tags my giant dog gets very distressed by the high pitch noise and starts trying to climb into my lap and then onto the kitchen bench which is an insane place for a dog that is taller than a human when he stands on two legs. I'd really appreciate some help as one of them is for his collar in case he goes missing.

- my phone is an S21 and I've just installed an update today (but it still does not work). 

- I've cleared the data/cache from smartthings and reinstalled the app. 
- I've reset the network settings several times on my phone.
- I've done the same to my family member's phone as we shared the tags.
- The smartthings app is entirely on my phone now as their phone is an old s7. 
- all of the tags were added to my phone first before I shared them with my family member. 
- I've pressed the button and added the batteries and held etc many times. 
- I've even bought new batteries and tried with all three tags. 

- the error message does change. It was initially the 04-201 error message that there is a problem with its Bluetooth information. But today when I tried the message had reverted to ""another person has already added this tag to smartthings. To use this tag, the other person needs to remove it from their smartthings app first"".

It says ""bypassing""  
And also read this 

 ""p **ower is delivered to system**  **and physical battery charging is minimized.** ""  
so it doesnt mean that power go through battery and then go to chipset.  
It means that power directly go to system, ofc it could send some small energy to the battery controller because battery need deliver power to system if you suddently unplug the cable I guess.  
One thing that sustains the theory that is a bypass , its the necessity to have a PD cable, because technically it is possible to pause charging with any cable, since the first android phone, because when it goes to 100% it's already stop charging the battery.  


I've done some tests with the option enabled and the heat was so minimal that you could say the battery is not being used.   
but if you let your phone charge to 100% and use it on gaming u will see the heat increasing, because it uses directly the battery and the charge feed the battery so its charging/discharging at same time";0

2553;14sdho3;SemiSage93;1688667662.0;Hmm, it's electronics so luck can be attributed to a good weight to each case as well as the specific usage. But just wanted to share, while Samsung still offers motherboard change, the next alternative, apple, doesn't even allow that. So compared to that it's still good that you spend 1/3 or 1/2 of the original value and practically restore the device with a new life while it's a total brick in case of apple.;0

It happened to me with my Pixel one. I literally just got off the plane from my holiday and lost all my photos and videos from my wedding and that. The internet was very slow or unusable over there so I couldn't upload anything. This happened within a few months of getting it, maybe even less. The phone bricked itself. 

Happened with my Note 10+ straight out of the box. Sent it to warranty repair within the first few weeks and they fixed it. It kept saying no Sim. 

Happened to my Rog Phone 2 while I was playing cod about 4-5 months in. This one was a nightmare and I sold it off as soon as I got it back fixed because it took 11 weeks to fix it and I had to send it interstate. Phone was unusable as it bricked itself.

2563;14sdho3;Citizen_V;1688684720.0;"I was in a similar situation. Both my S8 and S22 died because of motherboard related problems.

My S8 died suddenly because of a 'motherboard' failure. It *was* after 4.5 years but I've also had other phones that outlasted it. When I took it to uBreakiFix, they already had a guess about what happened because they saw several other S8s with the same issue. It was likely a PMIC related issue, something a lot of people also reported on Reddit ([example 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/mobilerepair/comments/i3m5mk/dead_samsung_galaxy_s8/), [example 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS8/comments/fhgjcy/s8s_motherboard_failed/), [example 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS8/comments/wimrdg/galaxy_s8_wont_turn_back_on/)). uBreakiFix couldn't fix it and said Samsung would just replace the entire motherboard. It wasn't worth the cost for a 5 year old phone, so I bought a S22.

My S22 also died because of a motherboard failure after 4 months of use, and was replaced under warranty. This time it was a slow death, where my phone was occasionally crash. This happened for several days in a row, and I thought it was just a misbehaving app. Eventually it corrupted Android and I couldn't boot my phone. Samsung replaced the motherboard and also the sub PBA for the charging port. I presume the latter had an issue as well, but I didn't notice it.

Despite that, I still own an S23 and I'm not too worried. Hardware failures occur and I may have just been unlucky.";0

- same answer as above. As long as you set it as default launcher, you don't need to open it like an app. It won't go back to OneUI if you press home or back button. 

- no, it doesn't drain an extra battery. It doesn't show up in battery devicecare.";1

I should give it a try as well. I'm using Niagara now and it's okay, but I don't love it. The idea of a minimalistic launcher was appealing at first, but I found it to be too limiting.

2704;14szkyb;batmonkey7;1688730006.0;"Honestly, the best bet is to put them on the phone itself. But there are other options.

Option 1) On the phone

50GB is music is about 12,000 songs, which is about 14 hours of music...

That's plenty and still leaves you room on the phone, especially if you get the 256 model.

You could then simply swap what music you have over time.

Option 2) streaming

It is relatively cheap depending on your none wifi data usage and how much data you get. It's honestly doesn't use much data to stream songs, and I doubt it would all be cellular data and not WiFi anyway.

Option 3) by a note 20 ultra

Slightly older device but will be cheap enough and has an sd card slot. No ultra phone since have had an sd card slot.";0

2721;14sgf6x;KentuckyHouse;1688694535.0;">It does the same thing as call screening on Pixel phones.

Not quite. 

It works great if you're not using the phone and a call comes in. Just tap the Bixby Call button, swipe up, and you're good. 

But unlike the Call Screen on the Pixel, it's manual only, meaning you have to invoke it yourself, whereas the Pixel can intercept calls automatically and route them where they need to go. 

And the biggest difference, for me at least, is that Bixby Call isn't available when the phone's connected to Android Auto. Because the call comes through the head unit, you don't have the option of screening the call. The same goes for the Pixel, but it can still work automatically in the background. 

Don't get me wrong, Bixby Call is a great addition, but I'd like to see them add an auto function where you don't have to invoke it manually.";0
2722;14sgf6x;bobbymack93;1688728174.0;Yeah, I just switched over to a pixel fold and have google assistant screen the calls for me it is so nice, and do wish Samsung would allow the same.

2768;14snssa;ChristopherLXD;1688687890.0;"The iPad Pro is only available in screen sizes up to 12.9‚Äù, not 14‚Äù. But the iPad is also a productivity tool that some people will make money using. The 50‚Äù QLED isn‚Äôt.

If you‚Äôre looking to make a comparison between just content consumption screens, a base iPad with a 10.9‚Äù screen starts at $449. Compared to the budget 50‚Äù QLED TV (assuming you‚Äôre looking at the Q60A), the iPad Pro 12.9‚Äù will have a much nicer screen, with a MicroLED backlight (2596 dimming zones vs none) offering much better HDR performance (1600 nits peak vs 500 nits peak), alongside higher refresh rate (120Hz vs 60Hz), better colour coverage (99% vs 92% DCI-P3 coverage), and contrast (1,000,000:1 vs 4600:1). It also just happens to be portable. 

I know for a fact that the iPad Pro displays have gotten good enough that they get used to review camera footage on film sets, and that‚Äôs just one pro use-case enabled by this technically capable display. At the end of the day, the Pro can be a business investment, the TV likely isn‚Äôt.";0

2888;14rdnrr;Joel__subash;1688644614.0;"Yes, but 

Wired transfer also needs Galaxy phone unlocked &  file transfer permission granting 

Samsung flow requires app to be opened on both devices and Galaxy phone to be unlocked 

Nearby share also needs phone to be unlocked and Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and location needs to be turned on even in phone 

But here Quick Share only needs phone to be unlocked.

Maybe unlocking Galaxy phone in all this condition is due to some security reasons.";0
2889;14rdnrr;Joel__subash;1688651284.0;"Is intel adapter driver up-to-date ? and is Quick share upto date in Galaxy store? 

A wifi connection is not required because  the transfer is done through wifi direct which will enable automatically., thats why we are getting this high speed transfer rate.";0
2890;14rdnrr;Joel__subash;1688666598.0;"In like to Windows we still have to open link to Windows app, mirror screen and allow permisson, go to gallery, then drag and drop

Some of these comments point to having issues with previous cards";0
2895;14rdnrr;DanzakFromEurope;1688624831.0;You need an internet connection for that. You don't need it for Quick Share (or atleast you technically shouldn't because it's WiFi Direct, just maybe for Samsung account sync).;0
2896;14rdnrr;Hextato;1688661850.0;Yup, I also tried that but it still didn't work;0
2897;14rdnrr;MoneySkin;1688644986.0;Makes sense, it would have been a deal breaker for me if it didn't require an unlock. For now, Samsung Flow does the job for me. It doesn't require the phone unlocked or app open on both the devices when its connected via bluetooth. I agree it's a bit slow, but it's seamless and does the job for me. When I have to transfer larger files I'll just switch to wifi.;0
2898;14rdnrr;Psylocibinpoop;1688740935.0;Where do I go to check if the Intel adapter is up to date? Thank you so much;0
2899;14rdnrr;TriaX46;1688668982.0;"Not necessarily. My app on windows starts automatically. Phone connects automatically. Need to click mirror screen, and allow the screen cast on the phone. Than drag the file on the homescreen of the phone üòâ

The difference here is that TSMC is just a bigger and better semiconductor company than Samsung. TSMC invests more into R&D for semiconductors does, hence they get better results. 

Samsung does want to turn this around as they're increasing their investment into their foundry business. Back in 2018 they only were investing 3 billion into it, now it's 15 billion, but it's still smaller than what TSMC spends to make their processes work.";0

You're not looking at this from the other side perspective. If you are in a group of 10 friends and you're the only one not using an iPhone, you're asking 9 people to change their ways just for you, everyone else they talk to, they would use a different app.

It's the same as someone coming to you right now telling you and all of your friends and family to use iMessage instead of Whatsapp to talk to them, just one person.... 

Yes it sucks, but it's completely understandable. It's not a 1 to 1 thing it's a 1 to many thing and asking a bunch of people to bend backwards to satisfy one person is silly.

The 50% of android users in the US either don't care, or have enough relatives/friends that are in the same boat and use a different app.

Apple is fixing this for their users anyway. Picture/video is going to be sent via iMessage for everyone with an iPhone in a group thread with an android phone, so the high res will not be an issue for them anymore.

I miss the magnetic stripe card payment thing from a few generation ago for the few remaining vendors that don't do tap to pay.

An invisible camera notch on front would be neat. And better video playback refresh rate is about the only gripe I have. This phone continues to impress me.

3163;14slcnm;wizzgamer;1688691697.0;S24 just need to optimise the 45 watt charging to actually be faster than 25 watts rather than just 5 minutes difference. Standard S24/Plus need better camera hardware maybe a 108mp main camera and 5x optical zoom. S24 Plus could do with a higher res screen to separate it from the standard more so that it's not just an upsell to the Ultra along with 12GB ram options. S24 Ultra should come with 12GB ram as standard like the S21 Ultra did and the zoom lens needs upgrading as they've been the same since the S21 Ultra apart from that the Ultra phones perfect.;0

3172;14slcnm;justarussian22;1688688148.0;Right! The spen is a gimmick. The fact that the last few generations of galaxy required you to get the ultra for the best specs is ridiculous. This is another reason why I'm looking at other brands mostly nothing. Hoping they can innovate better than Samsung. Hardware imo is more important than software. I hated the ui of my s6 but I could change launchers for a better experience. It didn't fix the horrible battery life but at least it was something I controlled.

I had one and actually loved it at first, but it barely lasted a year before it started going into a spiral of nonstop freezing/restarting. Just over and over and over with no way to stop it, every single time you'd try to use it. It never had issues until one day when it did an update, then suddenly it wouldn't stay on for more than 2 minutes without starting the freeze/restart cycle. 

Apparently that was a known problem with the A series phones, there are dozens of posts on the Samsung forum about it. Contacted Samsung and they were zero help, did not give one single F even though it's a widespread issue on their end and clearly not user error. They basically told me to go kick rocks.

I had a Galaxy J7 before that, which lasted for 5 years and probably would have lasted at least 2 more, so I was shocked at how bad the A51 let me down. I have an S21 right now while I save up for an iPhone.";0

But, the auditing software requires the larger screen of a tablet to be able to view all of the fields that require input.

And unfortunately the way the software works, photos need to be added at the time of each measurement. They can be added later, but that would be a last resort if a few specific points require higher quality and more detailed photos. It would be not at all practical to record data with the tablet, and take photos with my phone to add later.";0

By this, I mean for apple things will usually be a bit more coherent among all its systems as everything is integrated by the same company, what they see as best is what you get  but they make every bit to look in their taste and disregard anything they see as ""superfluous for the masses things"". 

On the other hand with samsung you have the quality things that likely work for everyone along with superfluous fun things that people may like (samsung dex that I can swear saved me at work a few times for example, the 10x optical zoom camera, all android customization, etc), plus being android its easier to add and remove bits from it, but it's not as optimised as while samsung integrates directly for its devices google integrates for the widest range possible so the base of gapps and similar will be far less efficient than apple apps or huawei apps you find in the other mobile OSs.

It doesn't need charging unless you wanna use the features that need bluetooth.

Downside- Android apps are not made for tablets unlike most IOS apps. Only a few apps will work properly and take advantage of the large screen.

Pixels take great photos and have essentially no bloat ware and some pretty neat software tricks that make it smarter than other phones. OnePlus and Xiaomi have software closer to iPhone and offer some unique features such as super fast charging and what not. Samsung is sort of your power users phone with endless features and customization but if you care for a polished, nuanced, or consistent experience it's not the best out there. Considering you mentioned your GF uses Samsung you probably are able to test hers out. Consumers in the US tend to default to Samsung as the android but there are tons of other great or maybe better options for you if you look into it. Maybe try buying one and take advantage of the 30 day return policy. I used to have a Samsung S10e and now recently got the Nothing phone(1).

Hope this helps, good luck lol.";0
3362;14r5xbf;t8tor;1688625594.0;Since switching from apple to fold 3 I am no longer able to receive group texts from iphones. Still trying to figure that one out. But so far I'm not missing apple.;0
3363;14r5xbf;vGraphs;1688635091.0;Android is just all around great. I dont like apple because their phones are the same every god damn year. My current phone, the s22 ultra, is a fucking powerhouse. The screen quality, the color, the s pen, everything about it makes me appreciate it oh so much more.;0
3364;14r5xbf;lligerr;1688641903.0;"Pros: Lot of useful features than Apple and is open for customizations. Can get paid APKs for free. 

Cons: Less smooth and premium feel than Apple. Apps little less optimized(except Google apps). With Apple, you can get serviced and buy accessories from anywhere in the world but here it's limited(depends on the country though). Apple has better videography and consistent photos(very small difference though)";0
3365;14r5xbf;Cheesybutlactose;1688884680.0;"Using both iPhone and Samsung, the cool features are mostly baked in apps such as iMessage, FaceTime etc. the benefits is those apps just mentioned, the way iMessage works is just beyond MMS and android alternatives. The other is the smooth interface and minimalist UI if you are into that, and Updates for years. 

The downside is that well you are using an IPhone. If you want to add other devices that aren‚Äôt compatible with IOS then you are out of luck. Customisation is also lacking a few paces behind the competition and lack of features such as periscope camera or USB-C until the new 15 comes out.";0

The laptop is really light, feels even lighter than a MacBook Pro. Battery is great, lasts a long time, charges quickly too. I dislike that the battery isn't easy to take out if or when I needed to replace it. The S pen is very light and has a great range of pressure sensitivity. My S23u s pen works with the laptop too. I'm peeved that there's no way to store the S pen inside the laptop so I have to be careful not to lose it.

As for Samsung apps....

Quickshare has been pretty easy to use and makes transferring files from my phone to the laptop (and vice versa) soooo much easier.

I also use Smart Things on the laptop to turn on/off smart lights and configure various other things without having to pick up my phone. 

I haven't tried Bixby on the laptop, so no comment. 

For texting, I use Phone link. That can be installed on any Windows device.

I'm so excited I learned something new today and love the theme with today being 4th of July and all.

I kinda like the oneUI icons, couldn't find any good minimalist icon pack.";0
3625;14qj5xf;mbpunjabi;1688630091.0;"Hello!

I setup my home screen so it could help in accessing a lot of stuff without having to stretch my small hands over this tall screen :D The goal was to have everything accessible from the bottom half of the screen with minimal navigation

I can access 22 apps and 10 quick settings from the bottom half, I call that a win.

If you like my setup, here's a guide below

**Wallpaper**: *Wolverine Claws* \- got it from Google

**Launcher**: *Nova Launcher Prime*

**Icons:** Flat White, Lines, LineX White

**Apps & Folders**

I got the Camera, Gallery, Browser, Messaging, Phone, Contacts apps here.Along with those I have 6 folders setup - Google, Media, Shopping, Office, Social and Samsung - swiping up or down on each folder opens up an app of its own (for e.g. swipe up on the Social folder opens Facebook - swipe down opens Instagram)

**Widgets**: *KWGT Pro*

They come in from KWGT Pro and packs called Vanilla & Flow within the appI customized the Calendar and Time+Weather widgets from these apps (you can do that within KWGT) to suit my style more

The bottom right is just a text widget I created within KWGT showing my username.

I have set a shortcut within KWGT for these widgets - tapping on the time, date & weather areas open up the clock, calendar and weather apps respectively, whereas tapping on the username widget opens settings.

**Quick Tools:** *One Hand Operation+* (You'd need to download Good Lock from Samsung Store or Nice Lock from the web depending on your region)

I have put a toggle handle on the bottom right of the screen, swiping left downwards from it opens up the quick tools area

I have pretty much set it to everything the regular panel allows me to do, there's also a button to bring down the regular panel. The only thing it doesnt show is the location toggle - I still haven't figured out a way to include that.

While the UX took around a couple of days to get used to, I simply cannot get used to any other phone coz I kind feel spoiled by this.

I set this up on my Note 20 Ultra and now I am using it on my S23 Ultra.

The camera is great obviously but for somebody like myself who plays lots of heavy duty games like Pokemon Go or Genshin Impact and listens to tons of podcasts, music, or YouTube while at work; the battery life has been fantastic and doesn't really heat up all that much to the point it has to shut down thanks to the phone's internal cooling system. I can even take my phone to Disneyland or a convention like San Diego Comic-Con for a whole day and it will be able to get through the entire day. Even set to Power Saving mode, the phone is still pretty snappy and quick. And since the screen is flat, it's easy to find a good tempered glass screen protector. I recommend going with Spigen's tempered glass screen protectors since they work fabulously with the fingerprint reader. I have owned several Samsung phones including the Note series and I think this might be the best phone I have owned to date.";0

I admit im from the few that actually prefer a curved screen but s23 is quite enjoyable...tried all uag and spiegen cases but an xtremeskin and a ringke fusion matte and I wont lie I love the s23 as much as the s10. Can live without a heart sensor and my sonys cover the lack of 3.5mm headphone jack. Video is much improved even over s22 and love the new snapdragon and battery autonomy. My only gripe is that you need to use alot of custom settings to get the camera to the needed level but autofocus issue is waaay better. But all and all i would take it over s20 to s22.

EDIT. Forgot to mention that no phone is a slauch. My S10 SD is literally as fast as the s23 even though 60hz. I ve never once experienced lag or slowdown in 4 and a half years and im a power uaer and do 10 hrs onscreen time a day sometimes 14.

Presently, there are a number of disadvantages to getting the S23+ :

Besides giving up your SD card storage (up to 1 TB), You will also be giving up your 12 GB of RAM.

The S23+ is shorter in size than the S20+... 

The screen resolution is less on the S23+;  2340x1080 vs 3200x1440;

I'm pretty sure the new gorilla Glass on the S23+ is easier to put micro scratches into... Would need to make sure you have a screen protector covering your glass.

I presently have the S20+ Snapdragon and I'm waiting to see what the s24 brings... There's nothing compelling at all about the S23+...  And although the S23 Ultra has the added zoom it will be too heavy/big for most users.";0

Tell me as the owner of an S20+, what is the compelling reason to go over to an S23+.  There aren't really any strong compelling reasons to make the swap... As I mentioned above, I actually give up items by upgrading to Samsung's newest/best device. 

I can easily wait an additional 6 months to find out what the s24 is going to have.  Or I can switch to another maker such as Sony if I desire. One thing is for sure, there is nothing compelling with the new S23 series to get me to upgrade from the S20+ to the S23+... nothing at all!";0

When the S22 Ultra came out I decided to switch and regretted it. The battery life was poor and the performance was sub par. It would hang apps, I had to force reset every few days etc. I was going to go back to apple until 23 series came out and the two biggest upgrades were battery and performance. This is the first android device I've ever used that I can say is just as fast as my apple devices. Zero lag or hic ups, I've never had to force reset or anything. And the battery life is amazing. For some people they don't mind hiccups with their device and can always get to a charger so it may not matter as much to everyone, but mattered a lot for me.;0

Btw my S20+ runs with no hiccups at all... it's as smooth as can be! Maybe that has to do with the fact that my phone has 12gb of RAM compared to what Samsung is now pushing out as ""acceptable"" in the S23+... only 8gb of RAM. I guess they didn't really take that away... üòï

Plus my resolution in my old S20+ is better than the new and improved resolution in the S23+... that's just a fact, but you and Samsung would probably consider that to be not terribly important... and something that was not taken away by Samsung... ‚òπÔ∏è

And less than a 5% increase in battery size, 4700 mah vs 4500 mah, is nothing to get too excited about. My battery life works just fine for my needs.  

Hopefully Samsung gets their act together and makes some ""meaningful changes"" in the s24+ and give back what they have taken away from plus series users so that people find  reasons to make the upgrade investment...

I have a phone that works amazing in any other regard, a Samsung Galaxy. But for some reason, ever since I bought it, this phone refuses to connect to the internet in my home. Or, no, it connects to the WiFi just fine, and there is a spike of about 15 seconds where the internet works... and then it stops working. It stays connected to my home WiFi, but with no internet data coming through.

I feel like I have tried everything. Initially I thought it was a router issue and bought another router, but no, the issue is the same no matter what router I use. 

Then I thought, maybe the network is to blame? Except all my other gadgets and devices use the high-speed internet just fine, and when I have guests over, their phones connect to my WiFi perfectly fine, so there's no problem with the internet provider.

Then I finally thought, maybe my phone's WiFi hardware is broken, after all, the issue is obviously within the phone and not the network. Except, and get this - it connects perfectly to all other WiFi networks. You name it: other people's home networks, McDonald's wifi, airplane wifi, etc.

So for some reason, my Samsung Galaxy, ever since I bought it, just cannot use my home WiFi internet for more than 15 seconds (and the funny thing is, if I disconnect, then reconnect, I get those 15 seconds of high-speed wifi each time I connect - so it's obviously a Samsung software bug).

## AIR FRYER VS CONVECTION OVEN

An air fryer can be thought of as a sort of mini convection oven. Both appliances use a fan to circulate heated air throughout the cooking cavity. An air fryer or a countertop oven on the air fry setting usually circulates the air a bit faster than in a convection oven. This can sometimes give you a crispier finish that is just a bit closer to an actual deep fried finish, depending on your recipe.

A convection oven has the same advantages over an air fryer as a regular oven‚Äîsize. If you‚Äôre making multiple dishes or batches at once, a convection oven can help prepare it all at once. But if you‚Äôre simply preparing one pan of crispy fried cauliflower, an air fryer is just the right size and can save you the time of heating an entire oven.¬†

For maximum flexibility, why not have both? Use your air fryer or countertop oven for single batches and your convection oven for bigger jobs. Having the additional countertop options is also helpful for when you‚Äôre preparing dishes with different cooking needs. Air fry some appetizers in your countertop oven while you slow-roast your entree in the convection oven. Lean more about [how a convection oven works](https://www.kitchenaid.com/pinch-of-help/major-appliances/what-is-convection-oven-baking-cooking.html) and how to use it.";0

The clouds looks way too dramatic and the hair in some pics looks grey. In contrast, my s23 is good in preserving the dynamic range more closer to what I see but it really boosts the colors in the image to the point that dress does not look the same color anymore. But you can fix high saturation, just turn it down in post. Not so sure about the hdr.
Overall I much prefer the usability of an android over an iPhone. Also the video in Samsung has come a long way. Unless you are doing side by side comparison, video is at par with the iphones.";0
3910;14qy8fw;Denis5508;1688528702.0;Both are amazing but if you really are like those people that care so much about shutter lag which i haven't noticed then get the iPhone. Also the video is a bit better on an iPhone so if you care about that then yeah. But I think photos are pretty equal with Samsung taking the edge in my opinion. Hope this helps bro;0
3911;14qy8fw;finchybriskets;1688532084.0;I think it varies on what you're trying to get out of it or what you wanna do it with it. I have an s23u, and I've been rocking samsung for a while now. The camera is nice and I try to use it for taking family photos etc. Then my kids are both under 4 and can't sit still to save their lives, haha. That's where iphones camera would be better for me personally. I just like samsungs. Maybe one day;0
3912;14qy8fw;MMusab_Salahi;1688554682.0;"If you are really serious about professional photography then i would suggest you to go with an iPhone as it tends to give more natural photos and near to real life colours, from what I have seen from the reviews the S23 Ultra applies heavy processing to the photos to make them ""social media ready"" and sometimes it oversaturate the image";0

Samsung has great products, and I'm happy with my phone, buds, and watch. I think their laptops are super nice, but I like having the freedom to choose other PCs as I please. 

I hope they follow this trend and unlock some watch features to other Android phones. I know there are many Pixel users who would love a Galaxy watch but haven't gotten one cause features are locked to the Samsung ecosystem.

Really though, my Mom's had this issue. Some robo call spam/phishing/scam whatever used ""cloned"" her caller ID. She was getting all kinds of irate calls from a neighboring area code, ""why are you calling me"" etc. She was distraught for a bit (she's in her 70's). Finally died down after a bit. Too a couple moths. She doesn't use her phone much so it wasn't as bad as it would likely be for someone who relies on their phone and number.

I've had a few calls where some said ""I got a call from this number?"" when I didn't call them. Only a few over several years but it;s weird. Not sure if it's an occasional ""clone"" or if maybe caller ID can screw up on occasion.

For a while I kept getting calls from my area code AND prefix. Scammers would grab a number with that beginning and call all the other numbers. SO when you look you think it's a ""local"" call. Thankfully that stopped a couple years ago.";0

AI Overview

Generative AI is experimental. Info quality may vary.

To add a secure folder to your Samsung Galaxy, you can do the following:

Open Settings.

Tap Security and privacy.

Tap Secure Folder.

Tap Continue.

Allow the necessary permissions.

If needed, sign into your Samsung account.

Choose a lock method.

Tap the Secure Folder on your App Drawer and input your password.

Tap Add App or Add Files to add data to your secure folder.";0

Absolutely proud of the power Management. I have a ton of widgets, many apps working in the background. Changing lock backgrounds, 4 photo album widgets, and I can get 16 hours total (5 SOT and 11 off screen). It is a full day almost. If I want I can easily get 8 hours of SOT.

One major problem is the wifi issue. Sometimes it just doesn't work multiple times throughout the day. I have to turn off/on the wifi, sometimes turn on airplane mode for it to work. There are other people reporting the same issue so it's not a just me situation. When it does work, the wifi is much slower than my Poco F3

Second problem is probably optimisations on games. I find Genshin to be smoother on Poco F3 than S23. Probably get fixed in the future though.";0

Coming from an already powerful Huawei device (455k AnTuTu, albeit with an LCD) i didn't think it was going to be that big of a difference BUT IT WAS. THE S23 IS SMALLER YET ABSOLUTELY TRASHES IT IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE.


I was holding off an upgrade until i found a perfect size, no compromise smartphone and safe to say this is it, just don't go for the 128g variant as it has slower storage

As for background apps, I will look into that. The battery is starting to perform a lot better though so I'll see how it all turns out in the end.";0
4431;14phqpk;Combativesquire;1688438902.0;U use a s23u? U probably got a dud unit if that's happening...;0
4432;14phqpk;Generalrossa;1688427535.0;"To me, as long as your battery is lasting you all day. Getting the same SOT as others have posted is near impossible as it's based on their usage vs yours and other contributing factors such as are they on WiFi at home all day with low brightness streaming YT. If you want comparable battery life to theirs then watch more YT lol. 

Waze + music streaming + 70% brightness + mobile data = 15% per hour. That sounds pretty good. I'm not too familiar with waze but isn't that a navigation app similar to maps?

Don't compare to other phones, specifically iphones. They are built differently with less features but a much more optimised software + hardware. Iphones will always get better battery life. My 13PM would get 2 hours more SOT compared to my S23U but in exchange the S23U is much, much more of a phone.";0

4434;14phqpk;crotal88;1688471115.0;I only used it in the first few days before the battery was trained and I had the same result as you so I turned it off. For comparison with my p30 pro I couldn't see a difference with it on and off. I'l have to experiment as well to see how it is now :);0
4435;14phqpk;Known-Middle-9241;1688528841.0;"For the most part it is the stop settings.

Might be the applications I have installed or just that I keep my phone on standby for too long so it uses so much battery just on standby. 

Idk, I'm using an M14 right now (typically from 8am - 2pm and it's on standby for about 3 hours or less in that time, and rest of the day is complete standby) and it hit 3 days on some 70-75%, that's better than my S23u! I almost exclusively use that on 5g, it's never being used on wifi.";0

4441;14phqpk;crotal88;1688621181.0;"Ok so I did a test since we talked.
I had the AoD set to always on from 07:00 - 00:00, and off for the rest of the night, and it used in a 24h interval 5%. It's a bit to much but probably you won't notice it much. Probably with other settings it could be better as you said you had it on for notifications.";1
4442;14phqpk;sinto03;1688638283.0;Yeah, though it still drains battery. If you have it on when you sleep, and you get a notification, it will essentialy be on all the time. So yeah, turn it off when you go to bed is your best go.;0
4443;14phqpk;sinto03;1688756647.0;I'm curious, how much SoT do you get with your S23U? And what apps do you use most on your phone?;0
4444;14phqpk;crotal88;1688769212.0;"I'm not what you would call a power user, most days I only have around 4 maybe 5 hours of SoT so I have a lot of juice left by the end of the day, high 60s-50s%. The few times that I used it a lot more I would say that I got around 7-8 hours SoT. 
I mostly use reddit, youtube, youtube music, spotify, whatsapp, and sometime instagram or tiktok. Of course I use other apps to, but those would be the most used during a regular weekday.";0
4445;14phqpk;sinto03;1688852656.0;"Yeah I guess I am a similar user to some extent. I have to say, the battery has been pretty insane the last few days. Last charge has given me 8hrs 8min of SoT and I am still using my phone, sitting at 16% rn, gonna play some games now and see how long it will last.

But what I have reaally been loving, is the fact that if I see my phone being on like 30% or mid 20%, I am not worried that it'll die if I go out to see some friends or something. I obviously am not using my phone during that time when I am out, but the battery barely drains. I was out for 5 hours and I drained like 5-7% since I used it for Instagram and a game. Definitely seeing an improvement after a few days.

4455;14puf26;Jitmaster;1688423075.0;"I tried to run an AI on an old laptop. The result is that the responses came back one word at a time very slowly.  The reason is that newer laptops have newer processors that have newer instructions, which have better SIMD(single instruction multiple data) instructions.  Since the code is simulating neurons, this allows more neurons to be processed in a single instruction cycle.  In other words, the AI can think faster.  So it all depends on how much AI you do and whether you want it to be fast.

I'm not sure if TOPS is a measure of those SIMD instructions or just regular instructions.";0
4456;14puf26;landonloco;1688423602.0;AI just helps in the SOC case to process data faster and more efficiently but it's use would be beneficial depending on what you do if photography and video then a SOC with dedicated chip to process that might be more beneficial I say might Cuz there other things at play like UI  and app optimizations and what not. On paper is better to have more but it's doesn't mean those particular tasks are gonna be faster or better with an AI dedicated cores which is what mobile SOC manufacturers are doing dedicated cores to better process certain stuff people do a lot on their phones like take pictures and videos.

Currently using A52 and I'm buying this last year just because i want to use Samsung's phone(especially one UI) and tbh it was not amazing but not bad.

Still, the Exynos 9810 provides more performance.
If your S9's battery is dying, and if you really care about the new features that the newer OneUIs provide, I would really invest in an S series phone, or get a better A series, like the A54. The A54's chipset is really energy efficient compared to the Exynos 9810, and provides slightly, but noticeable improvements to performance as it has newer software and optimizations. Obviously, the A54 will also provide you with better camera, battery, display (120hz).

TL:DR, invest in a better A series, specifically the A54 (in my opinion)";0

- The higher the brightness, the more battery it uses.

- The worse the wireless signal is, the more the phone will have to turn the transmit power up / add more error correction data / retransmit.

- While the phone is idle, charging and fully charged, Android optimizes apps with advanced optimizations based on how you use your apps, and these take effect for an app after said app is relaunched. Updates revert apps to basic optimizations. So, after an update, battery life may improve later. Source:  https://source.android.com/devices/tech/dalvik/configure";0

Assumed it was the screen protector ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è my fold 3 did this and I used it no issues before selling it and getting the 4.

Some people have fixed it by folding and unfolding the phone submerged in water. If you want to try that, use distilled water in case your phone lost some water resistance.";0

ran it for about 8 months being rough with it cause i am frustrated with it now, and boy does it still look pristine with only a couple deep scratches(i aint counting the dent it has due to my younger brother biting it tho) and figure if a plastic screen can survive that much abuse, my glass phone should technically survive any scratches i could throw at it";0

Like you, I wanted a ""pure"" Android experience and was hesitant to switch initially. The Fold 4 got me curious enough to make the move though, but even then, I eventually moved beyond that for a better camera/battery life.

I think Samsung got the 23U right. No complaints here. It's a solid phone and doesn't get hot like my P6P would sometimes. As a casual photographer, the camera is on par with the Pixel line, as far as I'm concerned. UI is noticeably different, but once I got used to it, I found it slightly more convenient, especially the optional sidebars I have set up.

I do have a ""Samsung"" folder where I dump duplicate apps that I can't uninstall, like the default browser, Samsung messaging app, and Samsung store app. I don't know why they bothered with their own Store app, tbh.";1
4848;14okawc;MTOP2;1688296150.0;"Former Nexus 4, Pixel 2 XL & 5 owner here. Now on the S23U.
Loved my Nexus 4 & Pixel 2 XL, but my Pixel 5 was worse than my friends Pixel 4a.


Pixel 5 main issues:
- I expected to have a similar performance to my Pixel 2 XL. Ya, it was a mid range chip, but it was way slower than my friend's Pixel 4a.
- In the last year, it would overheat (not shut down, but backing up photos was a challenge, kept stopping saying ""device too hot""). 
- The camera performance was inconsistent. The main camera was good most of the time, but the wide angle photos always looked very different than the main camera, and it was terrible in low light.


Things I prefer on the S23U:
- Performance is way way way faster than my Pixel 5.
- The Quick Panel icons are the better. I didn't care when Google switched to the larger pill shape ones.
- S-Pen, surprisingly, I use it a lot. Quick notes, doodling, websites, air gestures, signing documents, write to text, etc.
- Tons of customization and automation that is easy to use/set up. Lock Screen, Good Lock, touch macros, etc.
- Cameras are Fantastic, all cameras take great photos, 8k30p video, 1080p 960 FPS Super-slow-mo, consistent between lenses, 10x optical zoom (30x photos are useable), portrait mode, expert RAW, etc.
- Samsung Eco system. Got a Galaxy Watch, and it integrates well with my phone and can control features between the two (Theatre mode, sleep, etc)
- Samsung Health. Had FitBit before, and I hated that they put a bunch of data/info behind a paywall.
- Windows Link (access files and apps on your computer)
- Samsung Dex 
- Most Pixel features are available on Samsung or have a Samsung equivalent.


Pixel features I miss:
- Call screen, I didn't use it that often, but I seemed to help with spam calls. Bixby has a similar feature but haven't use it yet.
- Pixel 5 was the last pixel to have this, but Unlimited Photo/Video uploads. Pixel 6 and newer don't.
- Faster OS updates. While Samsung is getting better, they are usually a month or so behind with updates compared to Google.

Nexus 5x > Pixel 3a XL > S22 Ultra > Z Fold 4

I used the Nexus and Pixel from 2016 to 2022, 3 years each. I was never that into smartphones, seemed like such a waste of money when there were a lot more interesting things out there to do and see. However in 2022, I was offered a new job with a big pay raise and started upgrading my quality of life. I spent a lot of time debating Pixel 7 vs. S22U, and I decided to try out the Samsung experience side of things with the caveat that if I didn't like it, I'd trade it in and switch back to Pixel.

Its been an interesting experience switching, and there are definitely merits to both.

**Initial Impressions:**

* One UI has **WAY** more functionality than Pixel Launcher. Like its not even close. Its been a very rare case where I need to do some 'normal' function on my phone and need to go outside of what is already built into One UI. Samsung's software is generally pretty polished. I never really ran into bugs on either of my Google phones, and my experience has been the same with One UI.
* All of the Google services integration is still there on Samsung. I still use Google Lens, GBoard, Drive, Gmail, so on. You can recreate all of that on Samsung with very minimal effort. The one stumbling block was Samsung's Calendar doesn't pull in reminders you set up.
* Some of Samsung's apps I actually prefer over Google's, like Calendar, My Files, and Samsung Notes.

**Things I miss from my Pixel:**

* Camera...its the obvious one, but it's true. The S22's Ultra camera was very good ...but Pixel's is just effortless and far more reliable in getting a better looking image. I've tried putting gcam on my Samsungs but they've been too unstable for me to really want to rely on them. I really should look back into that...
* All of the calling tools. The call menu tree, Hold For Me, Call Screening, they genuinely make an extremely unpleasant and tedious task, a lot more bearable. I very rarely make calls so it doesn't come up much...but when I do? Man do I miss them.
* How light it was. I don't care how much metal and glass a phone is made of, I'm still putting a case on it. And if I'm putting a case on it, might as well make it out of plastic because that handles falls better and is cheaper and lighter. I genuinely dislike how heavy flagship phones are. I dropped my S22 Ultra more times in the first month than I dropped my previous two phones in the last 6 years combined, all directly due to the size and weight.

**Things I don't miss:**

* The latest updates. This isn't to say having them was bad, but I thought I would miss not having a fully up-to-date device. Honestly, I don't even really notice. It's just not a big deal, because Samsung keeps One UI pretty close behind, and also cribs features from both Apple and Google that those two are too 'brand focused' to want to imitate.
* Hardware reliability. Every Google phone I've had has had a hardware flaw. I went through two Nexus 5X's due to a manufacturing defect that caused them to eventually and die unavoidably. My Pixel 3a XL started boot looping, which is what prompted me to look at the S22U.

**Things I appreciate about Samsung:**

* Multitasking. Samsung's multitasking features are just so well done and I use them all the time. Being able to have popup windows, Samsung DeX, the edge panel, they're genuinely helpful to me.
* S-Pen. When I had my S22 Ultra, I used it all the time. It was an effective memory aid for me, since physically writing something would help me remember it better.
* One UI is ACTUALLY BLACK. It always boggled my mind that, at least when I was using it, the Pixel Launcher would not let you set your colors as pure RGB black, so the OLED pixels turn off. One UI's dark mode lets you actually turn it fully black!!
* The displays. I know the new Pixels have better displays, but nothing compares to the ones on flagship Samsungs. The colors, the refresh rate, the responsiveness, they're *sooo* good.
* Customization. I know Android 12 introduced Material You, but Samsung's GoodLock lets you have way more control over everything, if you're into that sort of UI customization. Which I am. TRUE BLACK BACKGROUNDS FTW!!!

**Things I dislike about Samsung:**

* Samsung really wants your money. There are always notifications in Samsung apps or nudges for you to purchase subscriptions or buy things using Samsung's tools. They recreated the wheel so they could get their cut of the pie and build their own ecosystem, and I don't appreciate it. If I wanted that experience, I'd buy an iPhone. Their services are pretty decent, but it gets annoying for someone like me who appreciates open systems.
* The cameras. Can you tell I'm not a fan? The Ultra series zoom is really cool, but otherwise I've consistently preferred how my Pixel 3a's camera performs when I did side-by-side comparisons. The Samsung's pics are higher res, but less real. The lighting and colors are a lot truer to life with the Pixel in almost every show compared to Samsung. The Z Fold 4's cameras are really not good imo. I don't have good luck with them at all.

**Summary:**

Pixel and Samsung have different philosophies in designing their products. Google is trying to make a very refined experience that genuinely makes working with your phone easier and less of a hassle. Taking pictures and communicating with your phone, its main purposes for a modern smartphone, are very simple and work extremely well and without much tinkering on your part to have a good experience.

Samsung wants to give you everything, it wants to be the center of your life, it wants to be something you just cannot live without. And honestly I think it can become that, if you let it. There are a lot of very useful features and integrations built into One UI that give you new capabilities you didn't have before. You may not use all of it, but you might use some of it and those things could become invaluable to you.

That being said, I spend **more** time on my phone with my Samsung than I did with my Pixel. Whether or not you consider that a good or bad thing, or even if you care, is up to you.

**Would I go back:**

I'm open to it, but at the moment, the answer is no. The Pixel Fold is intriguing to me, but there are just a lot of features on One UI that I've come to really appreciate and would sorely miss compared to the Pixel's unique features.

Given unlimited budget, I could see myself getting a Pixel specifically for the cameras. I'm not a photographer and while I understand exposure times and f-stop, I'd rather have a reliably convenient point-and-shoot experience that I just don't get on Samsung. Otherwise I don't call or take enough pictures to make the Pixel exclusive features worth it.";0
4855;14okawc;AliasInvstgtions;1688316263.0;In 2012, I got a cheap android as I was a kid doing odd jobs to have a cellphone and plan (my parents couldn't afford a phone or plan for me), it was an HTC one v. It was pretty bad, as expected of a less than 100 dollar smartphone. Then, I upgraded to another cheap LG, can't remember what it was and then I got another HTC, it was called a desire or something, with a plastic back that bubbled out within a month from the battery getting warm. Eventually, in Kate 2016, I switched to iPhone SE (first gen) once I had enough saved from a real job. Loved the thing. Upgraded to xr eventually which was a lackluster experience due to stuff like the screen burning in spots and other annoyances. Then, I had an iPhone 11, great phone, no complaints, switched to a 12 mini for the size, color, and 5g. Within 6 months, total battery capacity dropped to 85% max capacity and they refused to replace it under warranty. I didn't do anything different with that phone that I've done with any phone previous and any phone since, only one with that issue. Eventually, I had a trade in offer to fully cover the z flip 4 and I took it. I loved everything about the phone and it was a breath of fresh air from the iphones. Super durable phone, better battery than any of the iphones and a better camera than any of the iphones I had, too. After some issues with my carrier, I got out of the contract and wanted to ditch the t mobile bloatware. Figured I'd get the s23 ultra for about the same value as the z flip and get a massively better battery and camera than the flip. Love this phone and its the first phone I can picture myself keeping for years in a long time. So, not a pixel user, but I've got a pretty good variety under my belt and this has been my favorite by far.;0

Everything runs fast and smooth, it might stay a degree or two cooler than the pixel, but mine never had a heat problem. I enjoy one UI a lot so I don't even miss material U. There are so many plus signs for this phone. I used 5g once when I traveled 2.5 hours away and it was blazing fast. Battery lasts all day even though it's searching for a signal a lot. I get about 2 more hours out of the S23U than I did with the P6P. I think I'll mention screen brightness here, the Samsung annihilates the pixel in that. Both great phones, but to me for future, I choose the S23U as my daily driver. One thing I can get used to is the jump from 128 to 512gb storage. 8k video and raw pictures eat up a lot of space.;0

4861;14okawc;onekamaraj;1688312560.0;"P7P vs S23U

In terms of sheer potential, the S23U blows the P7P out the water. But the P7P makes up for what it lacks in brawn (hardware) with brains (software).

However, the folks from Google put a well-refined experience in your hands right out the box with great point and shoot camera experience, fluid snappy animations and little pixel exclusive features than go a long to improving your quality of life. The Achilles heel of the P7P is battery life. It struggles to hold a candlelight to the S23U's 1day+ of battery life under similar conditions.

The S23U however packs a better camera array, better SoC, better build quality, comparable speaker array, greater display, snappier fingerprint sensor, secure face unlock and the cherry on top that is the S-pen. The S23U is able to be a snappier device thanks to Samsung's exclusive colab with Qualcomm in the SoC department this year. You get also Dolby audio which is something that Google doesn't give you with the Pixels. The cameras pack a punch with better OIS on the main and the ability to make clearer lit photos out of what seems to be pitch darkness. Photos from the S23U still come out over saturated and with exaggerated colors and sharpness most times. While the S23U's photos are crisper, the P7P produces photos that are just as great but look truer to life.

In addition to getting more times out of a fully charge battery on the S23U, it charges faster too often getting a full charge in about 1 hour.

Given the tinkerer that I am, If I had to pick one device, I'd pick the S23U because with sufficient customization, it gets even with and way better than the P7P. If what you want is a cheaper flagship device that shoots more accurate photos with smoother UX out of the box and don't mind having to recharge two or more times a day, the P7P would be your pick.";0

Yes, if you regularly take pictures of moving subjects, you're not going to be happy with Samsung's cameras.";0
4889;14okawc;yungfishstick;1688390609.0;"The camera is definitely still very good. I'd say it's a step below Google when it comes to JPGs. As for manual controls it's far superior to Pixel but Samsung's RAWs aren't as good as Google's RAWs. Pixel by default does stacked RAW and so does Galaxy in the Expert RAW app but while Pixel's 12MP RAWs look fairly natural without any noticeable processing, Galaxy's 12MP stacked RAWs look pretty artificial from all 4 cameras as it's baking sharpening into the image. Turning sharpening down in an editing software like Lightroom helps a little but you can't get rid of the sharpening baked into the image. Dynamic range tends to be very good but the processing just ruins everything else. Nighttime is the only time you should be using 12MP mode in Expert RAW as in difficult lighting the whole processing pipeline and frame stacking helps more than it hurts. Their 50MP stacked RAWs, however, are amazing and are honestly the only reason to ever use the app. Some phones in high-res mode will have worse dynamic range but in this case dynamic range is the same as 12MP mode and the images are much more detailed with more room for cropping along with a much more forgiving noise pattern in some conditions. Zooming in all the way will still reveal a more artificial look to the details but compared to 12MP mode it's still a drastic improvement. 12MP tends to look more artificially sharp than 50MP downscaled to 12MP.

Regular pro mode (single-frame RAW) is just okay. 12MP RAWs in good lighting look perfectly natural without all the processing issues of Expert RAW but they tend to have some noise no matter what. In difficult lighting conditions the quality nosedives so you're better off using Expert RAW. 50MP RAWs are not very good and aren't detailed. They almost seem upscaled from a lower resolution. Dynamic range for both modes is worse than Expert RAW only because there's no frame stacking but it isn't the worst thing ever. 

Night mode is easily on par with Google's except with much better details, though there's no night mode RAW support like there is with Pixel if that matters to you. Color accuracy/white balance isn't as good as Google's but it isn't too far off. Even though Expert RAW stacks frames it doesn't compensate for hand movement while stacking so you'll end up with motion blur at longer exposures. 

As for the rest of the phone, I use it exactly like I used my 6 Pro so I haven't really used many of the features it comes with and just use the bare necessities. I can see the appeal of the S-Pen but I only take it out to use smart select for screenshots so it's nice knowing it's there but it's kind of useless to me. The S23 Ultra is a great phone but unless you're a power user or don't mind opening your wallet for one of the most well rounded phones on the market I'd personally stick with your 4a if there isn't anything wrong with it or wait for the 8 Pro/8. Unfortunately Tensor is essentially Exynos with a different name and carries all of Exynos' problems, most notably poor efficiency, relatively lower performance and worse battery life. Tensor G2 is no better than original Tensor since it's basically just the original Tensor with a slight overclock and better modem so hopefully G3 is a substantial improvement.";0

I can live with the lack of Pixel exclusive features and my pet is a 9 year old rabbit with arthritis so he doesn't move around very fast but if you plan to upgrade to a Samsung phone and one of your primary use cases is to take pictures of your kids, pets, or other moving subjects then I'd maybe stick with the Pixel line up or maybe look at the iPhone. 

When it does come to the camera, the front camera is better on the s23. The video is a lot better, and sill photos of stationary subjects are on par with Pixel. 

The battery life on the s23 ultra is fantastic, the screen is great, and I enjoy some of the other samsung only features they have in android.

Also, pixel 7 series seems to have a very bas camera lens. It just seems to break very easily even in your pocket, if you ever choose to buy one, I strongly reccomend a lens protector.
Coming from a Samsung Ambassador, and a samsung authorised tech, the A series is built for everyday users with better batteries than the S series, ok processor, ok cameras ( even if every phone nowadays seems to have ""great"" cameras ) but they are not built to be use more than your 2-3 years contract. I mean, you CAN still use it, but as you experienced, it just get slower and battery last shorter.
I personnaly would reccomend S serie if you are the kind of person noticing the processor rapidity. I sell a lot of used S21 to my customer and they are very happy, for a low price point. Only issue is the battery, but honestly once you get used to using fast charging, its very not that big if a deal, since a quick 15 min of charge gives me 40-50% wick is way more that i need ( coming from a ZFlip user, they are known for having bad battery)

4968;14okjxo;tremor100;1688318993.0;" TLDR: Cant get samsung to replace my warrantied NVMe, also cant seem to get them to put me through to a manager/supervisor to escalate as they don't care.

Hello all, venting here since not sure where else or if anyone else can relate.

I bought a 1TB EVO PLUS NVMe in late Dec 2021 off amazon, waited a few months to install it.. had it running my main OS for about 8 months. The following December, my computer randomly wouldn't boot. Re-formatted on a seperate SSD, when i got back into the OS and took a look at the device, it had tons of bad blocks (including the ones that had the OS on it) i was able to take off some of the data, but alot of it was corrupt... whats worse, is since all the boot and permissions are corrupt, i can't format or wipe the drive.. ive tried everythig, its completely locked, so essentially bricked. Samsung not only has a 5 year warranty.. but its even plastered on the box in pretty large writing 5 YEAR WARRANTY.

**Support Chat 1:** Asks me a bunch of questoins likely off his standard call handling.. no worries.. i explain to him above.. takes forever to validate the item asking me tons of questions.. then finally says.. okay well we can RMA it, but first you need to go to an official Samsung repair place.. I ask... its a flash memory device with bad blocks... what are they going to do ""its part of the process, they will either fix it like new or diagnose its defective"". They give me 2 options (not official samsung stores just stores that are licensed to repair Samsung product).. both 30 minute drives from me. I ask chat.. is there a reference ticket or anything?! like I just show up and ask them to look at it for free?! don't they need to know this is through support ""no its fine just go in"".

I drive down to the store, tell the whats up.. the person at the store literally tells me ""its a NVMe drive.. what do you want me to do with it?... we only fix phones or hardware"".

**Support Chat 2:** Explain everything to the new chat rep, including my pointless drive out to the repair shop... re-validates everything.. then tells me ""you need to go through amazon"". Im like.. dude.. i bought this over a year ago.. why would amazon RMA it?! ""anyone who sells our product have an arrangement with us that they replace the item""... so while hes typing this nonsense to me.. i go to Amazon support.. and i go to my order for 2021, try to request a return on the item.. it doesn't just say ""sorry contact your vendor"" generically .. but specifically the link to the chat i was currently on.. and the official Samsung support 1800 number. I tell the guy.. yo.. im already on the site, it says its you guys ""nono you cant use chat or their return process.. you need to call"" im like.. i really doubt some random person a ttheir helpdesk will know about some special Samsung arrangement.. ""trust me call... I will get someone to reach out to you on my end to get things rolling if they can't replace it, but they will.""... get off the chat... get an email from them like 20 minutes later basically saying ""yea go contact amazon, k, thanks"".

Contact Amazon... and to no surprise, they say.. this is ordered way too long ago for us to cover it.. contact your manufacturer for the warranty.

**Support Chat 3:** Explain everything above.. tell him how im getting pretty frustrated... puts me through all the troubleshooting and validation steps again.. tries to get rid of me again.. i put up a fight, and he says okay no problem il get the RMA going.. heres your ticket number, and someone will reach out to you soon to get information regarding shipping ect.

Finally think ive gotten somewhere.. wait 2 weeks... nothing.. go into chat to just find out the status since i haven't been reached out to...

**Support Chat 4:** Give a breif background and the ticket number... she tells me that that ticket number doesnt exist or match a format of any system they have there (guy lied about making a ticket to get rid of me). So at this point i kinda lose my shit... explain to her everything that has already happened, she apologizes and says I am going to get ""customer relations"" to reach out to you regarding your poor ex\[perience and make this right. I explain... what exactly is the ETA on ""customer relations"" because it sure feels like for the 4th time, im being told to go away and wait or do something else.. she says 2 days maximum but her guess is within a few hours.

2 more weeks go by... im done with this shit.. so I call to speak with someone. I get on the phone with a phone rep.. explain everything up until now.. explain not only should this premium level SSD not be dying in 8 months, but the way ive been treated is actually insane. She starts revalidating and troubleshooting everything again.. she doesnt even seem to understand what an NVME or my problem is, she thinks im talking about an external harddrive ect. I was trying to not get mad at her because its not her fault.. but like... i just explain all the crap i went through and then i spend 25 minutes going through it again.... so after over a halfhour.. she tells me ""im going to send you to business to business.. thats our escalations department and should be able to help you further and hopefully get it replaced.. Im like thanks! She asks me to sit on hold... i wait 10 minutes.. takes me off hold.. says shes transfering me..wait 10 more minutes, same woman tells me okay here we go (i assume shes handing off the case)... i get transfered to another employee... ""Hello Samsung business to business how can i help you"" im like.. did the previous associate not breif you?! ""what? no my phone just rang and i picked up"" im like YOUR ACTUALLY kidding me right now... she cold transfered me?! ""i guess... whats your ticket number"" im like i dont have one.. becaus ei just spent 45 minutes talking to someone who ""escalated"" to you.. which apperently just means cold transfering my call ""okay whats your issue"" my NVME is broken i need it RMA'd ""oh.. i can't help you.. let me transfer you to tech support sec"" im like NONONO ... I'm done with this.. transfer me to your manager.. im so fed up. ""I don't have a manager"" im like then transfer me to the Tech support supervisor .. not random tech support.. the manager ""okay sure"" ... she puts me through to the generic support queue.. get a new agent.. we start from scratch again... I tell them im not going through this a 6th time.. give me a manager.. she keeps making excuses trying to stall me.. says her manager is in a meeting...

Tells me she can't escalate to the manager if she doesn't know my problem.. so I give her the overview, but i tell her, this goes so far beyond getting this replaced.. this is the most insane support ive ever had, all you guys do is try to get rid of people and pass the buck ASAP.. i need to speak to a manager or supervisor, im not doing this again.... tells me all the managers are in a meeting, but validates my phone numebr and email.. and says i will get a call ASAP.

2 weeks later, still nothing... what do I even do at this point?! Its crazy to me this is how a company like Samsung conducts their support. Seemingly its impossible to get through to anyone outside of level 1, and whenever i try they just get rid of me. Anyone with a similar experience (hopefully not this painful) that figured out how to get it resolved?";0

It's hands down the nicest and most expensive TV she has ever had but unfortunately without the damn One Connect Box the TV is useless. Are there any alternatives I could buy for her? People are asking 180 to over 250 to 300 dollars for just the box and up to a 100 or more just for the cable and that's just way to much for me to afford let alone gamble on the chance they're reputable good people selling a working non defective product.

5020;14o2ops;Generalrossa;1688252678.0;"For as long as I can remember I've been customising my android phones and as much as I can. 

Start with the many options that goodlock for rhe basic samsung stuff such as changing icons, keys cafe and whatever else theme park brings that you want to use and then use a third party launcher such as Nova if you arent going to stick with the stock one.

From there I use KWGT for widgets and sometimes KWLP for a whole another homescreen experience but lately not. Then I'll use a video wallpaper and call wallpaper. 

After that I'll use hex to customise system elements and change my DPI 411-650 depending on how I feel.

Home Up - You can make your app drawer or home screen display more apps, make smaller folders so it's easier to reach, edit task changer so it's also easier to reach

One Hand Operation - has tons of features. You can make it so that one swipe from the edge of your screen you can turn on flashlight, take a screenshot, etc I like to include Quick Tools in this so I can easily access some stuff from the notification panel without having to swipe from the top of the phone. Tho I think you'd have to have gestures turned on with this instead of the navigation buttons.

Multi Star - also pretty great for easier multi-tasking

Edge Panel - This one isn't in Good Lock but you can enable just in the settings. You can do so much with this. Just a quick swipe from the edge of the screen and you can access a calculator, clipboard, smart select, or apps.

Hope that helps a bit!";0

5092;14nwg9q;Driftan;1688240317.0;"There's quite a bit of fearmongering in these comments. Your phone should be fine. If your phone was constantly vibrating because you had a button pressed down, and it was in an enclosed space, there's nothing out of the ordinary about it getting hot. There's an old galaxy note 5 (2015) I own that has a software bug that causes it to constantly vibrate until the phone is restarted (which happens every month or so), and it gets pretty hot if I don't immediately catch it, even though it's out in the open and under a running ceiling fan that's set at medium. Your phone getting extremely hot in an enclosed space because it's constantly vibrating for an extended period of time is expected.

As for the battery percentage jumping down from 85% to 84% rather quickly‚Äîas someone else has mentioned in the thread‚Äîthis is normal. This happens on my S23+ as well. It most likely stops charging immediately after reaching 85%, so it's unable to reach the higher end of an 85% charge (closest to 86% charge).

For the transfer process being interrupted, since it was between an Apple and Samsung device, I'm going to assume this transfer process was done via wireless? My transfer process went smoothly, but I was moving data via a wired connection between two Samsung devices (Galaxy Note 8 [2017] to Galaxy S23+), so maybe your issue might have stemmed from transferring data between an Apple and Samsung device, or maybe you were transferring wireless and that caused your issue if the connection wasn't stable.

5107;14nwg9q;ClearheadedActress;1688224382.0;Oh really? :( I thought it may of gotten hot because it was in the closed box;1
5108;14nwg9q;Generalrossa;1688253551.0;Yeah this is completely normal behaviour.;0
5109;14nwg9q;ClearheadedActress;1688229829.0;Ahh is that the case? This is the first Samsung phone I've had and the first phone that can only charge to 85%. My iPhone didn't do that as far as I'm aware;0
5110;14nwg9q;ClearheadedActress;1688242734.0;Thank you so much for quelling my fears. I think the returns time crunch is getting to me. Plus I bought it with a few deals so even if I returned it and bought a new one it would cost me almost ¬£200 or more to replace it;0
5111;14nwg9q;ClearheadedActress;1688227916.0;Thank you. I realised that it probably wasn't much use so I have uploaded a picture of my current useable today in the comments (although even just doing that has drained 2% of the battery!);0
5112;14nwg9q;Papa_Bear55;1688230215.0;Looks like it's the Always-On display that is making a bigger impact on the battery. The phone drained 16% battery after around 7 hours of use with AOD on so it's not bad I would say. Disabling AOD would probably help too but I wouldn't worry too much;0
5113;14nwg9q;ClearheadedActress;1688300871.0;Did it turn out alright?;1
5114;14nwg9q;Pennywise1131;1688233202.0;I just can't fathom needing to charge twice a day unless you game A LOT. Just yesterday I streamed music for 8 hours while at work, with occasional texting, browsing, then at home browsed some more, general phone stuff, watched some YouTube etc. Ended the day with 61% battery left. This was an S23+.;0

5119;14nwg9q;Generalrossa;1688253848.0;"Lol why are you still on this sub spouting nonsense to OP. I see you had a bad experience and that's probably on your end if you changed to a few S23U's, that's even if you're lying. You probably had apps running in the background or had a combination of using mobile data, maps, high brightness etc which does eat battery. 

Look around, people are easily getting more then 5 without youtube. Personally I'm getting 6-7 from 85% on the average quite easily.";0

You just need to turn off ""protect battery"" in settings. If you can't find it easily, just search for it. If I misunderstood this, then just ignore this. Oh and dropping from 85 to 84 almost immediately is normal considering power cuts off immediately it hits 85%.";0
5124;14nwg9q;hsredux;1688280781.0;"If the phone only charges to 85%, then you have 'protect battery' on, which is a good thing btw.

On a side note,15% more isn't going to last 15% longer. That's because batteries struggle to hold maximum charge capacities, and it actually causes more wear and stress on the battery when trying to charge to 100% all the time.";0
5125;14nwg9q;Alien_303;1688300434.0;"The iPhone lies about battery all the time. For example, you can use iPhone with 100% battery for 40 min, and it wouldn't show any drop. I call it BS. Here is an example and comparison of battery life between iph and s23.

5127;14nwg9q;Fiorix1725;1688230124.0;85% to 68% with 6 hours idle and 1hr 20 min SOT is pretty normal. 17% in an hour 20, will bring you to 6+ hour SOT with an 85% charge. I wouldn't be worried. AOD drains maybe 5 -7% especially with that much idle time. And if it's fairly new your battery will get better over time.;0

if that would be old grumpy man in his 60s who is close to his retirement, he will probably do nothing. If you will find young man who is very helpful, he might do something. you can always provide anything (like if it was on marketplace, and you have chats, or any other selling website) they can always at least try to find via IP, if someone was not really careful (e.g. selling from his own home), they can find him. Also, was that trade made online (via post) or did you met him in person? maybe there was a camera somewhere, who caught you two.

also, it may not be his first steal. they might have other cases similar to this - once my brother's gf (now wife) bought dress online. paid and never received. went to the police, and after few months they called her they found other 20 girls with the same problem, and that they found a man who did this.

It is on par if not better compared to the iphone 14 series. I am sorry but with the horrible exynos on the s20+ i think there is a very big reason to go for s23 series.

5269;14o6dy6;JBond-007_;1688507840.0;"In my opinion, the ""few extras"" that are offered with the S23 Ultra are not that big of a deal over my S20+ which has Snapdragon 865. And when compared to the S23+,  there are even less incentives to upgrade!

As you say, my S20+ has expandable SD storage up to 1TB... In addition, my S20+ has 12 GB of RAM rather than the 8 GB that Samsung now says is all we need... sounds like a downgrade or yet another Samsung profit making measure...

My S20+ has way better resolution than the S23+;  3200x1440 vs 2340x1080... 524 vs 390 DPI.

And my S20+ is the perfect sized phone which happens to be about the same length as the S23 Ultra. - Incidentally, I'm one of a small minority who can somewhat comfortably carry around the S23 Ultra... but for most people, it is too big and too heavy.

So, for someone in my shoes, I'd coincidentally give the exact same advice that people were giving on this forum 8 months ago...  

Wait and see what the S24 offers when it comes out in 8 months and then make a decision. If the S23 is the best phone at that point in time, you will get a huge bargain on it! And if the s24 is a better phone, which it just might be,  then take advantage of the early buy/pre-sale specials.

If someone absolutely needs to buy a phone right now, they could either go for the S23 or another phone at 1/4 the cost of the S23.  IMO there really is no hurry to jump into an expensive S23 & accessories at this time .. not enough benefits from Samsung vs what they have taken away from us customers. üòï";0

Not sure what an S23U costs (on sale, upcoming sales?) , but it would make a great 5 year investment. I don't suggest payments on one, but in this case: a 5 year phone with a couple of years of payments.

Motorola?

5375;14nf3hy;ggjunior7799;1688224502.0;"The easiest way to know if the s21 ultra is genuine is by dialling * # 0 * # in the dialer. It will show up the diagnostic screen. If it doesn't show, it's not genuine. Then, you can test each function of the phone from that diagnostic. 

Another thing to take note of is that you have to test out the camera. Some old S21 ultra have very bad autofocus (hardware problem), and you even need to press into the camera itself for it to focus (i had encounter one person tried selling me their s21 ultra with this major issue touting it as in perfect condition and another listing that honestly said that the autofocus is broken). To test this issue, try focusing on something using the camera about a meter away. It shouldn't take more than half a second to focus.

If you're not comfortable meeting people, and would rather just buy used phone online (highly not recommended as many seller could lie in their description), try asking them to record a video for you using the s21 ultra, while they filming the s21 ultra itself with their own phone.

I highly doubt this autofocus issue is common, though. It's just for peace of mind.";0

Bonus answer you can use the settings to make any app fit the inside screen and be rotatable.

I value battery life, and stability and power of the chipset. I also value software updates though not as much. I don't care nearly as much about other features like the camera quality. I found this website that ranks phone batteries called ""DXOMARK"" and I don't know the reliability of their testing but it seems like Nothing Phone has the edge in terms of battery. In my country the Nothing Phone (1) is 25% more expensive than the A54 so do you think it is a good value proposition given my preferences?

I don't feel apps on android are worse than iOS ( at least at this point in time), on the other hand some apps like whatsapp, telegram are just better looking on android and I find them easier to use. Yes, photos taken by in-app cameras are definitely better on iOS.

The thing is iOS is differently designed and so the apps are suited according to it while android is just more fluid when moving around. When one moves from iOS to android, they are used to how iOS functions (like there is a particular select button, done button, back button in iOS but in android it is usually long press, swiping back etc.) and so they find android app clunky. And iOS users in when moving, are more likely to complain compared to android users who have always been fed that iOS is the superior OS and so they just shut up adapt to iOS ways & means.

5466;14mz49t;Bryanmsi89;1688142079.0;"3 reasons (and this is not true for EVERY app, some are better on Android).

1. **iPhone consistency:** Apple has a much narrower range of devices to design for making it easier for developers to build apps without worrying as much about CPU, Memory, Screen size, etc. 
2. **iPhone popularity**: in the USA, most people have iPhone (including the developers themselves) so they build the apps for the audience
3. **Android fragmentation:** iOS updates work with most phones, so the OS fragmentation is far far lower on iPhones than Android.  Android app developers have to contect with a huge range of potential OS versions and sub-versions along with manufacturer UI skins 

According to StatCounter, in North America slightly more than 1/3 of Android phones are running Android 13 which is nearly a year old, and the most popular version is Android 10 which came out in Sept 2019 (almost 4 years ago). Meanwhile, more than 85% of iPhone owners are using iOS 16 (the current version).";0
5467;14mz49t;Interesting-Sir-9776;1688135269.0;Simple, apple pays app developers to only optimize for apple products. Samsung is the most popular brand worldwide so makes no sense that apps like Snapchat aren't optimized for Samsung. It's not THAT difficult they're just either too lazy or purposefully not doing it;0

Android has users running different versions of Android OS with different top skins like oneUI, pixelUI,  Oxygen etc.  There is also different hardware, screen size etc.

Its very hard for small developers to test for that.    Apple had a better set up for app developers, so can make better apps.";0

5479;14mz49t;JackOfTheIsthmus;1688199360.0;"In most cases I did not see any difference. Popular apps like Google (Mail, Calendar, Keep, Maps),  Deezer, Pocket Casts, Weather&Radar, seem the same on both systems.

One point for Android is that in third party apps the system-wide text scaling always works. Move the slider in Android's screen settings and the font size will change everywhere to your liking. Not so on iOS! Move the same slider there and while in Apple apps the font size will change as expected, in third party ones it will not in some 2/3rds of apps. Or, it will change only on some screens but not others within the same app. Of the apps I mentioned above only Gmail has it implemented everywhere. I don't know why the same developers can do it in the Android version but not in the iOS version. (I find tiny text very tiring to read so this is an important /but personal preference/ thing for me).

Another story are my local Polish apps. Of the local apps (banking, public transit, healthcare etc.) some are the same quality on both, but some are markedly worse on iOS. The opposite does not happen. I think this can be explained by the very low iPhone ownership here.

Finally, there is one type of app where iOS apps are way better. The Keepass clients. I tried KeePassium and Strongbox on iOS; and Keepass2Android and Keepass DX on Android. The Android ones are quite clunky. Also the autofill implementation on Android seems much more a hit and miss, so maybe the poor user experience is not only down to the apps. Anyways, the iOS clients are paid and quite expensive while the Android ones are free (with voluntary donations). I think the difference here is that for the iOS Keepass client developers writing the app is an income-generating job while for the Android developers it is a hobby and they can only devote so much time and effort to it, can't hire a graphical designer, etc. Maybe we need a paid Android Keepass client?";0

Also most apps don‚Äôt scale quote right for different display sizes. I currently have an S23 Ultra and many apps look a bit cartoonish scaled up to its larger display.

As far as app stores, lots of reports over the years about how the iOS App Store generates a ton more sales than Android (this includes in-app purchases and subscriptions, of course).

It‚Äôs pros and cons. I like Samsung hardware more (truly legendary displays), but the downside for app development is the lack of parity in design language across the entire ecosystem. Apple has a lot more parity, but the downside is the look and feel of iOS is difficult to personalize (you‚Äôre really just locked into the Apple aesthetic).

5583;14mz49t;RonaldNeves;1688161644.0;"man, you don't know how developing works. every bit, every byte the companies change on the base operational system, and every minimal change they make on hardware basically changes everything.

when you make an app, you make it based off the operational system and then try to optimize it for every hardware. now imagine that every month, a major company release a new android phone. it is impossible to keep an app updated and a 100% compatible with **every** phone.

it is easier to do on iPhone cause they use the same SoC architecture and operational system for all phones, and they only release one new phone per year (the 14 and 14 pro are essentialy the same phone).";0

5586;14mz49t;Interesting-Sir-9776;1688168585.0;thats why we have AI that can do it way faster than humans lol;0
5587;14mz49t;Interesting-Sir-9776;1688310516.0;Yes so letting your product suck for specific of users bc you can't be bothered to fix it is the answer? Sounds like the devs just threw in the towel after taking 10 minutes to optimize for apple;1
5588;14mz49t;Interesting-Sir-9776;1688189824.0;So? They really can't do this over the span 9f a year or figure out a way to speed up the process? Yea right;0
5589;14mz49t;Interesting-Sir-9776;1688223245.0;Ok so iphone gets done in a fraction of the time and then the remainder should be used to fix android phones right? If apples so simple then why not get that done first then do other phones that are popular? They've had years to figure this out and just haven't.;0
5590;14mz49t;JoinetBasteed;1688309996.0;They all dont use the same software and hardware, that's the problem;0
5591;14mz49t;anonyy;1688497677.0;Lol companies lie all their time to benefit them haven't you learned that by now;0
5592;14mz49t;anonyy;1688805691.0;it's not nonesnese i have 2 iphones and about 5 android phones. i had an app called FAR (Free App Report), they highlighted the apps that went free i  owned 2000 of these apps before it closed down a few years ago.  A portion  of these app developers stop working on them, they were damn good innovative apps too.  The same has happened on android thats just just down to development of computers in some areas most users have android. China are switching to their own branded phones rather than using american so you can add a few hundread million of android users. Ios charge the earth for their apps as they have a smaller customer base.  Same like apple computers most pc/laptop users use WINDOWS [os.](https://os.so) so they have to charge more to make up the shortfall in numbers.;1
5593;14mz49t;Interesting-Sir-9776;1688138723.0;But if they resent using it then that's bad for business. It's not enough to simply have and use the app there has to be ample engagement. Again, by refusing to do their job and optimize it, they're shooting themselves into he foot unless they're getting paid by apple;1
5594;14mz49t;Interesting-Sir-9776;1688156950.0;Oh no how horrible that must be. Literally take the time and prioritize samsung, then google phones. God I cannot wait until AI replaces you guys working at the speed of molasses because theres no way its THAT hard to do. Otherwise there'd be almost no apps in the google store.;0
5595;14mz49t;Interesting-Sir-9776;1688168645.0;I know i cant. But these are people who have a career in coding and cant seem to do this task. how does that make sense;1
5596;14mz49t;Interesting-Sir-9776;1688163399.0;So theres no way to design a program that can automatically make the required optimizations based on new input criteria? We could land humans on the moon in the 60s but cant make snapchat pictures look good on android phones in 2023? Give me a break. There are ways to speed up the process but the need isnt there. Imagine if these issues were present on iphones. This issue would get resolved overnight.;0
5597;14mz49t;reindeerfalcon;1688202219.0;Sentences like these are why I know you don't know what you're babbling about. You're right but it's only paints a small part of the picture;0
5598;14mz49t;JoinetBasteed;1688309895.0;Sorry to break it to you but AI isn't even remotely close to replacing developers;1
5599;14mz49t;JoinetBasteed;1688314796.0;Again you seem to think the developers are the ones deciding what to do, have you ever had a job in your life? It's the higher ups that makes decisions, and they often base those decisions on the ROI, and optimizing for specific phones is almost never a good ROI;0
5600;14mz49t;anonyy;1688283646.0;That's upto Developers they don't want to spend anymore time and money checking and amending their code than is necessary;0
5601;14mz49t;Interesting-Sir-9776;1688310640.0;They don't all use one ui? They don't all use snapdragon in the US? And exynos abroad? No way there isn't a more simple solution for one brand each;0
5602;14mz49t;Clever_Angel_PL;1688152554.0;maybe start using AI instead of your brain, as it seems to be struggling so definitely AI will make it easier to be open-minded;0
5603;14mz49t;jleep2017;1688149017.0;It's not really reset it's more cost efficient to not do it. If they do their jobs become 10 to 50 times bigger than what it would normally be because they have to do that job for every phone. That's like a tailer making jeans for every person individually. Instead of the average shape. He then has to measure every person and do it exactly tailored to him. Instead of doing a general size. He also can't release the jeans until he does everyone's pants either. It doesn't make sense.;0
5604;14mz49t;ibrodirkakuracpalac;1688157930.0;Lol you are the first one who will be replaced by AI. Anyone thinking that any task can't be THAT hard must certainly have the brain capacity of AI.;0

you really find easier to believer that apple bought out ALL developers of the world instead of accepting the simple fact that closed system are easier to develop and maintain?

5613;14mz49t;Interesting-Sir-9776;1688157431.0;No, its more like a tailor finishing one pair of jeans for a family easily (apple) then spending the remaining time tailoring other customers (androids) and then making copies of their specific measurements or chanign them slightly year to year;0

It is not meant to *look good*, but have a practical value that no usual smartphone category provides. But it comes with compromises such as being more fragile, not dust resistant, heavier and much thicker, the weird form factor, the crease in the middle of the foldable screen, the hinge that may not work as well after one or two years, somewhat sketchy app compatibility, older generation cameras, mediocre selfie camera...

Speak with your colleagues and see it it's all roses for them, I don't think it will be.

Like everything, there is no perfect product, but products tuned to certain uses but also worse at others.

I mean, Samsung has had time to refine its formula, and it is probably the most reliable foldable on the market, but we can see other manufacturers trying slightly different aspect ratios and managing to remove the gap when folded, so there is still definitely improvement to be made.";0

Honestly I was really surprised by the battery. It's great on par with the pro maxes, which is a first foe android.

As for cameras, zoom is unbelievable, there is no competition. However, I have to say not a fan of photo processing, photos look a bit fake even with HDR turned off. But iphone is no better at that part especially with 14 series.

All in all, i like the phone. Will I be keeping it a lot longer? Unfortunately no bcoz it's HUGE. Literally the biggest phone. It get uncomfortable to use for me. 

I hope Samsung realises a similar specced 6.1 inch like apple does with the Pro model.";0

Coming on to battery life, I have the battery protect thing on( so it only charges to 85%) and I start recharging when battery level reaches 20%. Still get around 5 to 7 hrs of sot( depending on if I am outside and using mobile data instead of wifi). Also, this is with Bluetooth being on always and display set to max resolution. 
I don't use the camera a lot, but I usually get better pictures compared to my brother's iphone 13 pro max. 
Finally the software. I have only had one big( sometimes while scrolling ( say reddit for example) the copy, cut, select, option bar pops up and doesn't go away until I select any of the options). Besides that haven't noticed any bugs or software issues.";0

Cameras are great, especially the zoom. You need to experiment with the different cameras modes, I uses the food camera mode and night mode alot. I find the pro mode best for when something overexposed/too bright, you can tone it down.  

Software is good, one of my favorite features are the edge panels, can access your favorite contacts,apps, write quick notes, quick calculator, and more easily. And should check out the galaxy store, there are apps that will enhance your experience.";0

The iPhone 15 is \~3 months away and maybe it gets a zoom camera. Which would be the only big difference in my eyes from the 12PM.

Waht are you missung with the iPhone right now?

5892;14mz611;sfw_sfw_sfw_sfw;1688144229.0;It kinda depends on your needs. I had a zflip 3 coming from the s21u. It was an amazing phone but it was plagued with issues. Camera failed within a year, inner screen died on me after a year. It's fun and compact. If you want a good camera, the zflip might not be the one for you unless you are just a point and shoot kinda person. Battery life, it's very average. You might have to charge it midway to your day. If you are very active in messaging, you have to keep opening and closing your phone which might wear out the initial screen protractor faster. So see what you are currently using most on your s8 first before jumping into it.;0

> The S22 gave me about 4 hours of watching videos or 6-7 hours of Spotify before it was stone dead.

So this is like from 100% to 0%.

And this is from 100% go 99/98%? 

Time to upgrade.";0
5905;14mhhv5;realterrencewilliams;1688245023.0;S23 Ultra is the first phone I had to actually turn down the brightness with.  The phone is amazing, but it was literally making my vision terrible.  Eventually, I realized it was eye strain.  Once I put the phone on adaptive brightness, my vision improved.  It got to a point that I could read tiny font such as food ingredients on product labels.;0
5906;14mhhv5;BlackSeaDeluge;1688085540.0;That's just about how it was for me. 100% when I wake up, 90% when I start my day, 5-20% by the end of the day. New phone just kind of gradually, slowly goes down until it's at about 40-50 percent depending on use, maybe 60. Would recommend.;0
5907;14mhhv5;BlackSeaDeluge;1688088801.0;By barely touch I meant barely contributes to dropping levels. The battery does naturally decrease over the course of the day through other factors. I'd estimate if I was just doing Spotify and nothing else I could run it for 10-12 hours.;0

Can you make some additional battery comparisons on your S23U? For example:

\- 1hr of web browsing on 4G: dark mode vs light mode (I mean light color)

\- 1hr of web browsing on 4G: 60 Hz vs 120 Hz

\- 1hr of web browsing on 4G: normal resolution vs highest resolution

\- 1hr of web browsing on 4G vs on Wifi

5961;14mcxmt;TealCatto;1688147746.0;Honestly I don't know why fully wireless buds became ubiquitous. They are just worse than wired (to each other, not to the phone) earbuds. The wired ones have the battery in little packs further down the wire so the in-ear part isn't heavy, but if it does fall out, it doesn't fall to the ground because the wire is around your neck. And if you want to take it out of your ear, you don't need to look for a place to put it. Just let it drop. Also battery life is like 3x as long. I use Sony WI-C310. Comfy, don't fall out, not an issue if they do fall out sometimes, and only $18 (Amazon US). I feel like I'm trying to advertise them but I swear I'm not. I just went through a few different ones until I found the perfect solution.

6030;14m9cnt;TealCatto;1688061723.0;I had a Sony XZ1 Compact phone that was square like that. It was tiny though, and even so it made a hole in my pocket after a year or so. Squatting was also painful because I would get poked. I happen to like the square look but I also like small phones so I would never use a squared Samsung because they're all too big. And I know that if I had trouble with a small squared phone, a bigger one would be worse. Aesthetically though, the history is interesting. Phones used to have rounded corners but square screens. I remember my first phone that had rounded corners and a rounded screen - LG G6. I still have it and I loved it for being so innovative and aesthetically pleasing. Since then it was considered higher end to have everything rounded, but now square gives off higher end vibes I guess, because rounded became old. Honestly, as long as the body and screen match, it's fine with me. I happen not to like extreme rounding. iPhones are almost ovals at this point, lol. My S22 base is probably the most rounding I can handle. I tried looking up the degree of corner curvature on the S22 vs iPhone and couldn't get results because everything is talking about curved screen edges.;0

Next month I have some meetings regarding this with samsung sales, apparently for companies they implement something like Knox Guard that is a completely separate system and it gets flagged in the bootloader, and people have really hard times getting it to bypass that (samsung uses this for their trade-in protection).

When you get an eSIM you tell the telecom provider that you use  this particular phone and it's IMEI is linked to your number after that you don't need a physical sim anymore and your phone becomes the identification for your number and nobody can change it because the company asks for verification which only you'd be able to provide;0

Both are more than fast enough for anything you'd want to do. Unless you're taking pictures of fast kids or pets, both camera systems are excellent.

If you're looking for pure value for money, there are a lot more options than the Samsung S series to look at.

I've used both an iPad and Galaxy Tab, and honestly ... its the same situation. Both are good. iPad has the more mature software ecosystem for art, Galaxy S Tab has better hardware in most aspects except CPU, but they're both tablets and do all the same stuff. Galaxy Tab's have a better aspect ratio for content consumption and have better speakers. Samsung DeX is pretty cool. Samsung S Tab line comes with an SD card slot with expandable storage, and a pen which is arguably a little better than Apple's, if writing is a major use case for you. If you're using it for art, you may have more luck with the iPad just due to the apps available.

Just keep in mind that if you go with Apple, you will pretty much have to use only Apple products for the foreseeable future to get a good experience. You won't have that limitation with Android.

Since you mentioned gaming, I want to add that if you want to do any kind of emulation, you'll probably have an easier time with Android than iOS, but you can do emulation on both.

Edit: One final note is that it's a lot more common to have to purchase apps and subscriptions for certain things, where they may be free on Android. An example of this is moving photos around that you take. You only get a small amount of storage through iCloud for free and its the only real easy way to move files on and off of your phone. Its really common to have to buy a subscription to be able to manage photos easily, where you don't have to do so on Android. You have free access to the files on your device and you don't need to go through a cloud service to easily move things around.

Edit 2: I'm realizing this has become very pro-android where I originally intended it to be unbiased lol. Just want to reiterate that both are great. You won't be unhappy with either.";0

This is coming from someone who is using Samsung tablets since November or December 2013 (Tab3 10.1, Tab S2 8.p ve and Tab S5e). 

For phones, it is mostly personal preference. The S23 is a very solid device and it isn't heavy, plus comfortable to use. I have the S22+, which is similar in size, and I like the design.

If you don't care about that stuff then it's not an issue.  But college can be a hard transition for some and to be excluded from group chats because of the phone you use could make that transition harder.  Again, it's a silly thing that's only really US centric, but it's a hard fact.";0

6149;14m18l3;inventord;1688087046.0;"I think I was in a pretty similar situation to you a couple years ago. I went with an S21 Ultra back then, and I still use it today along with my M1 iPad Pro.

Battery life on my phone is pretty decent, and I've heard it's outstanding on the new S23 lineup (especially the plus) with the plus having basically the best battery life on a phone. That said, iPhone also has generally good battery life, even if it's not quite to the same level.

As for performance, it's interesting. Both iPhone 14 Pro and S23+ are extremely fast, and you will have no issues with either. It's generally accepted these days that the Snapdragon 8 gen 2 has a better GPU than the iPhone, while the iPhone 14 Pro has a better CPU. Both will do fine at everything you throw at them.

The cameras on both devices are generally excellent. In normal conditions, both will take excellent photos and videos. The iPhone has traditionally has better video, but I'm happy to say it seems really good this year on the S23 series, basically on par with the iPhone (and it can shoot 8K, if anyone ever actually used it). iPhone tends to produce more true-to-life colors as well with Samsung having more instantly shareable photos (higher saturation generally). Which you prefer is your call. In my experience though, Samsung still gets a win in a few areas: zoom, portrait mode edge detection, night mode, and HDR performance (I notice iPhone still likes to overexpose the sky in many cases which Samsung seems to have solved with some software magic). Samsung also gives you a much more customizable shooting experience, allowing you to shoot in high resolution or even open a full-on pro mode with focus peaking, ISO and shutter speed settings, etc. Many people do prefer the ProRAW captured by iPhone though.

Both devices are pretty similar in terms of durability as far as I'm aware. Both are water and dust resistant, and both use some sort of ""scratch resistant"" display. Apple touts its ceramic shield but it doesn't seem to do much in terms of real world protection compared to the competition.

Biometrics are also pretty similar. Both have face recognition, but Apple's is more secure since Samsung just uses the front camera without special sensors. Apple's method also works in the dark. Samsung has the benefit of a fingerprint scanner, which also works in the dark and with wet/dirty fingers.

Now for the biggest difference: the OS. Android is more customizable, manages notifications better, has more features, and generally gives you more freedom. You can multitask (which I actually use more than I would've thought I would to look at things side-by-side), install apps like YouTube Revanced (basically YouTube premium but with even more features), newpipe, etc. iOS also has its benefits though, with the main one being higher camera quality in social media apps and the integration with other apple products. (To be clear, Samsung's performance in social media apps is still pretty good thanks to Samsung working with the companies, but it's not *quite* as good as iPhone). Many people also prefer the animations on iOS, although animations on Android have gotten really good. Personally, I like the Pixel animations the best, but Samsung animations are really smooth these days. If you want a comparison of them, I'm happy to do one. App quality is also better on iPhone, but it's typically not easy to notice, and I'll gladly make the tradeoff for a universal back gesture that *always* works


I will point out one big gripe I have with iphone though: the keyboard on many android devices (Gboard) is seemingly miles ahead of the one on iOS. It has better autocorrect, a dedicated number row if you want it, themes, etc. Google assistant is also still wayy better than Siri, and I don't see thar changing any time soon. In general, android is just smarter IMO.

Finally, you have the ecosystem. At this point, apple's is just better. If you don't have a Mac though, you might not ever notice it, as my Watch, phone, and PC all work really well these days. I swear Samsung and Google are really catching up, because I can easily ""airdrop"" files to my PC, text, activate my hotspot, etc. Apple gives you things like iMessage and FaceTime as well, which you don't get on Android. There are ways to get them though (I use an app called BlueBubbles, and there are some cool looking apps coming out, one called sunbird, that don't require any kind of Mac at all).

I take notes for classes in goodnotes and write my theses in Microsoft Word, also because I prefer Word to Pages. I don't use my phone to take notes for class or to write theses.

Before I bought the S23+, I also considered the iPhone 14 Pro. I choose the S23+ because ... 

... some Apps I like using for learning (e.g. ankidroid) are much cheaper on the Google Playstore than on the Apple Appstore. 

... when i bought it, there was the preorder free storage upgrade plus I got a few percent off the price through unidays. Unidays currently offers 10% off of Apple products and 15% off of Samsung products if you're ordering them from the Apple/Samsung website. If you're in university and unidays is available in your country, you're eligible for their discounts.

... at most tech shops where I live, you can ""test"" the phones as in there's a model in the store and customers can see how apps like camera, notes, etc. work. This way I found out that I prefer Android over iOS. 

Arguments for the iPhone 14 pro would be that the A16 chip is slightly better than the Sanpdragon 8 Gen2. Apple's camera is also said to be slightly better. I don't have issues with the chip, and I say this as a heavy user and the difference is only small afaik. The camera on the S23+ is fine.

You can replicate the iMessage part on Android with apps. Right now, you need some sort of a MacOS instance (like a VM or a Mac) but it looks like that may be changing soon. You can also receive facetime calls on Android via links, and some apps have experimented with allowing you to create facetime calls as well.

> Apple Pay is better than android pay

If you mean Google Wallet, I've never found that to be the case. It always works seamlessly on both my phone and my watch, and I've never really had an issue with it. Plus, typically where one platform is accepted the other is as well.

> Apple login to websites works much better than Google login

I suppose that's subjective, but both should work on the same amount of websites. I have an iPad Pro and honestly don't see any difference between it and my android device.

> Apple's ecosystem is just much better built

Fair enough. I think that's changing with things like Nearby Share for windows and the Phone Link app though, since my Laptop, Watch, and Phone all work pretty well together. OP did say they have a Mac though meaning they likely won't get the ""ecosystem experience"" anyways.";0

My left hand is off my phone but I'm using my middle finger and thumb to hold it.). It's pretty heavy to use with one hand and I feel like I might drop my phone if I use one hand for too long. If I'm on my back laying down.

It's a great idea because you can prevent someone from erasing or adding a new esim which pretty much locks it up. I could be mistaken but I don't believe you can add a physical sim with the SIM locked either.

It also prevents someone from stealing your phone and trying to erase your esim and replace it with their own and keep your phone or sell it on the black market.";0

6382;14m0xeo;Captain_Kahn;1688094684.0;"Good evening all this going to be a wall of text and I apologize ahead of time. 

I ordered a Samsung CU8000 TV for ~500USD that was delivered June 13th as a gift to my younger sister. The television was delivered without its power cord and no remote. 

The same day I contacted Samsung support who put me though the ringer as I tried to resolve this issue. It was eventually resolved with them agreeing to send me a new power cord and remote through warranty. The power cable arrived ~7 days later with no TV remote and my ticket was closed. 

I called Samsung support again to figure out why the remote wasn't sent and they claimed there was a processing error in their system and claimed to have rectified it. 

9 days later the remote still hasn't arrived, so I have once again called Samsung support who've advised that another processing error prevented the remote from shipping and that they will send the remote to me free of charge when it was their fault I never received a remote in the first two instances. They also told me it could be another 5 to 14 days for the remote to show up. That would mean I've had a 500USD investment that's been utterly useless for a full month.

Now I'm being put through the ringer again when I'm asking if there's any way they can compensate me for the issues that they've caused, and if they can expedite the shipping of the TV remote. The only consolation I've been given from a supervisor is that they can attempt to expedite the process but even that's not a guarantee.

I've had Samsung products for a long time. Counting off on several dumb tvs, a Galaxy Note 3, S3 Frontier and S8+, a Note 10+ and Galaxy Fit, S20 Ultra and Watch Active2, and S22 Ultra with Watch4. Not including several pairs of Galaxy Buds and a Q6F Special Edition QLED tv. I would say I don't usually get frustrated or push for compensation on simple customer service mistakes but IMHO this isn't a simple mistake anymore and I'm not sure who to reach out to so that this issue can be fully rectified.

6421;14lhf8w;Safe_Opinion_2167;1687986123.0;"I have an S21 Ultra (same generation as S21 FE) and an S23. For most tasks, there is little difference, the S21 generation is still good enough for today's applications. Applications start a little faster and games are a little smoother with the S23 but you really have to push it harder to have a noticeable difference.

Nowadays, Samsung provides 4 years of OneUI / Android updates so that means that the S21 FE will stay current until 2025. That does not means it will stop to work from one day to the next.

You should not expect a huge gap in performance and shall rather motivate you change with features you don't have or improved battery life on the S23 range. 

Beware that the Fold 4 is not really an upgrade but a sidestep to a different category and you have to be ready for the compromises foldables have to make to provide the big internal foldable screen. Some come back to a normal slab phone because they cannot bear these compromises. The S23 ultra is also bigger and heavier than the S21 FE so it is not for everyone.";0

6423;14lhf8w;bamboleini;1687978367.0;Except gaming I highly doubt on anything you would clearly notice. In battery life it should be better (especially true for s23 ultra).;0

6437;14l8vix;chanchan05;1687957785.0;I moved from a Xiaomi Miband 6 to a Watch 4 this year (it was on sale for like $90 brand new then) and I think it's a good purchase. It's still good for 2 guaranteed OS updates, and I don't really see any issue in keeping this beyond those last two updates other than probably the battery giving out, and Samsung has a track record of sending updates beyond the guaranteed window anyway. I personally feel it's still a good purchase.;0
6438;14l8vix;shkl;1687966129.0;My active 2 which I bought in 2019 broke a few days ago which is when I bought the galaxy watch 4 classic 46 mm for INR equivalent of 110 usd. These watches can last for a long time and watch 4 is quite snappy. My only gripe is worse battery life than active 2.;0
6439;14l8vix;penguinina_666;1687966253.0;What is your intended use for the watch? If you are serious sports person and need it for good tracking, then I would always get the latest. If you are like my husband who just needs it to screen calls and check notifications without taking the phone out, it's a much cheaper alternative. If it's a new watch, battery will hold for the next year or two without noticeable degradation anyway.;0
6440;14l8vix;Trisentriom;1687990103.0;Watch 6 comes out next month. Wait then buy watch 4 at a lower price;0
6441;14l8vix;ojasmohan;1687968923.0;I have the watch 4 and honestly it does everything I want it to. Granted I use it mostly for notifications and fitness tracking but still, it's a great watch for both of those things. I will say, the OS is a bit laggy at times but it's not too bad.;0
6442;14l8vix;Maos_KG;1687970817.0;Yeah, I love my watch 4. I previously had the 1st gen and that thing was awesome. I ended up giving it to my dad since I upgraded to the 2. The 2 was super nice as well, but I put it through the ringer that's for sure lol üòÇ and it ended up not working or turning on and off on its own, so I eventually upgraded to the 4 and I've been loving it, definitely doesn't get as abused as my 2 did.;0

Secondly, a firmware was pushed to mine at some point and that firmware bricked mine and others. I haven't been able to turn it on without it going through a vicious rebooting loop.

I bought it with the full knowledge that it's at best a 1.5day a full charge watch though, so it's not a big deal to me. Just didn't think just adding another half a day of charge is worth 2x the cost of the watch (Watch 5 40mm costs 2.5x the Watch 4 where I live, and the Watch5 Pro costs 4x).";0

I'm about to upgrade to the 5 Pro as it seems to have 2 days of screen on time battery life or at least a week with the screen off. The Watch 4 is maybe 1 day screen on time (?) and maybe 2.5 days with the screen off. I am honestly not happy with that.";0

6524;14kvrsw;Hybrid-Moment;1687926062.0;"I am not optimistic that the update will bring much change.

Honestly, for the first time in years, I've been considering switching to iPhone. I've had the S3, S6, S7, S8, Note 8, Note 9, Note 20U, Fold 3, Fold 4, and now currently the S23U.

Early on each upgrade felt pretty significant and was extremely exciting, and with each software update came big changes and features.

Ever since the Note 9/S20U, every phone has felt identical and less and less exciting. I dream and hope for a majore OS release to make me excited about the phone again bit each time I'm left disappointed.  I thought folding phones would bring the excitement back, and they did for a time, but the cons outweighed the pros.

That all being said, I know Iphones aren't better, they lack features and have subjectively worse specs. However,  the OS experience would be a dramatic change and they have a ton of charm in ther animations/UI/graphics etc. Eveyr feature feels planned and matured.

I just want my phones to be exciting again. Idk if they would come from making the jump to iPhone or not, but I'm considering giving it a test drive.

Amazon offers a 90 day return window on used devices. Tempted to buy a renewed iPhone and take it for a spin for a month and see how it compares.

It's the bare minimum. Also some apps don't even completely follow One UI theme rules like one hand reachability of some apps like Samsung Music.

2. **Animation revamp.** Honestly, the main thing One UI lacks behind is animations, especially when it comes to fluidity like the stock Android.

3. **120hz screen recorder.** It's currently locked to 60fps, which is fine, but could be way better.

4. **Declutter and combine apps**. Samsung's additional apps are way too much and needs to be incorporated within other built in apps like camera assistant and expert raw should be into the main camera app, enhance-x should be a part of the gallery, Samsung Health and Health Monitor should be combined, and so much more especially with Good lock that should be incorporated into the system. It's a way to declutter and simplify so much things.

5. **Optimize One UI.** One UI is a heavy skin. On flagships, it runs great even after years, but on midrange and entry level phones, the experience just sucks. This could also help improve battery life as the drain is bad for a lot of people.

6. **Lock screen widgets.** Underrated and underrused feature hidden behind tapping the clock. They should bring this out to be more accessible and useful.

6660;14kvrsw;stelgado;1687970261.0;I don‚Äôt understand your point. Optimisation is all in all a good thing for any phone. And no one does it better than Apple, because of obvious reasons. That‚Äôs why they can afford to sell under spec‚Äôd phones and they still run smoothly.;0

6662;14kvrsw;general_clausewitz;1687981900.0;"Under specd?

Apple Silicon SoCs are flagship grade. They beat android SoCs pretty easily while drawing less power. Hence better battery life.

The only significant area iPhones are under specd is their RAM. That's fixed by aggressive ram management at the cost of User Engagement and experience. 

There's a difference between aggressive optimization and optimization. At least that's how I see it. Apple's optimization is king. The ecosystem also allows for third-party optimizations to be very easy. Android has a million different devices so you definitely miss out on the specific third-party optimizations. That's not to discount the fact that apple does it better and Android has reasons for it's optimization problems.

OEMs like Google, Samsung started optimizing really well. At least their flagships. The real under specd affordable smooth king is Pixel. 

Android feels comfortable when you multitask. In pursuit of matching with apple, I just don't want to lose android what it's good for. Aggressive optimization is not good in every case. 

Eg:
- Battery optimization - how are you doing it? By killing apps aggressively in the background? I don't want it.

- Ram management - same as above

Apple strength is Apple itself.

Android weakness at least on the ease to optimize is android itself.";0

Leaving downloads with screen off, I downloaded a 67 GB video and it went on for a couple of hours and Android didn't kill it. Things like these are so much better on Android. All my apps have default battery settings. 

If it's the notifications you are talking about, the most used ones which I have notifications turned on work well. In some cases are delayed by 3-4 minutes. Of course these are managed by Google Play Services so can't really blame samsung. I'm happy with background app management. Sometimes I'm so annoyed when I open some of the apps and they still stay on the same page but I was expecting to start anew so that I don't have to press back multiple times to get there and refresh the app for new content.

Edit: Of course If you want always running apps like vpns and others, that's where OneUI might be rated the worse. You can remedy that by changing the app battery settings and you are good to go. It's also needed only once.";0

6754;14kramg;Armandeluz;1688582818.0;I don't think you understand his question fully. Apple and Samsung intentionally make it difficult to switch to other companies. It heavily relies on you syncing your contact to Gmail and after moving vendors those synching back. This works seamlessly using a Gmail account to anything. If you save everything on your Samsung account, you do not always have everything transferred over unless you are using their new Onedrive Microsoft option. Calendar doesn't sync at all leaving Samsung. This is also true for Apple. They do not have the ecosystem setup for you to leave them only importing in certain situations. Only flawless to upgrade with their respective platforms. Always use google for everything regardless of the vendor. If you're on apple, keep google contact sync on for that reason. You can always download your files and pics from Google drive. Apple photos doesn't work like that.;0

Had S10 since release until a month ago, changed it because the charging port stopped working reliably, battery was less effective but still good, it had a cracked screen, but still worked fine. Only reason I changed is the charging port.

I like the S22, but miss the headphone jack on S10, I have good wired earphones and when bluetooth dies on my bluetooth headphones the direct port is useful.

No regrets, but would recommend S23 over S22 for better battery life if the cost is comparable. S22 has better battery life than my old S10, but not as much of an upgrade as S23.

If I could have gotten another new (not refurbed) S10 for a reasonable price would have stuck with S10.

Good AOD (it's working pretty well on S6 with little draining even though it's not supported). Might lag sometimes, you will want to tweak some settings in hktweaks (app preinstalled).

I am not sure if this is the bootloop as I couldn't find much information with this exact scenario

A relative of mine has an old J5 that's we change the battery for a new one because it wouldn't turn on, now when it turns on it sits at the Samsung logo that keeps lighting up and dimming without stop

I tried a few methods to turn on the phone including: - power button + volume up - power button + volume down - power button + volume down and up - power button + home button + volume buttons

None of which work When the phone is plugged to charger the animation for charging appears as normal

6852;14l5bn7;chopkinsbass;1687974536.0;"I know people have reported ""banana"" images with the S23's camera but is anybody else experiencing warping with the video camera modes?

For the last few weeks, whenever I do videos of myself playing the bass for my YouTube channel, there's a lot of warping at the edges of the videos.  I thought it was a focusing or stabilization issue but it's happening with manual focus, auto focus as well as image stabalization on or off.  It's also happening in 3rd party apps such as Filmic Pro and Open Camera.

Ironically it's not happening when I use my A52 and A41s.

I've reset the phone, cleared settings and updated to latest version available (mine is running Android 13 and One UI 5.1).  

As an example - this is a video I filmed when I got the S23 and there isn't any noticeable warping or distortion:  [(1) EP 129 ZZ Top - Legs - Bass Cover (includes onscreen tab and downloadable tab) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9whjoyU0XP0) 

This is one I did recently and you can see it is really pronounced, especially on the right hand side of the video.  Also - the neck looks like it's exhibiting ""banana"" characteristics as per the issue with images  [(1) faith synched trimmed - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oswWIpCNR7M)

Not allowing ""What should I buy threads"" is ridiculously restrictive as evidenced by the fact that the majority of posts are currently directly or indirectly related to choosing what to buy.
